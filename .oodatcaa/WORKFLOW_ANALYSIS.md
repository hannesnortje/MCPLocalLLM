# OODATCAA Workflow Analysis - MCPLocalLLM Project

## ‚úÖ Expected Agent Flow (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Launch Negotiator (Background)**

**User Action:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run the prompt in .oodatcaa/prompts/negotiator.md exactly. 
Return only file diffs.
```
**Run in:** Background

**Negotiator Detects:**
- Reads SPRINT_GOAL.md ‚Üí Status: "Awaiting First Sprint Planning"
- NO SPRINT EXISTS condition is TRUE

**Negotiator Outputs:**
```markdown
## Coordination Status ‚Äî Sprint 0

### Actions Needed:

‚ö†Ô∏è LAUNCH AGENT: Sprint Planner
- Reason: No sprint exists (SPRINT_GOAL.md shows awaiting_planning). Need to analyze OBJECTIVE.md success criteria and create Sprint 1 for MCPLocalLLM project.
- Command: Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
           Run .oodatcaa/prompts/sprint-planner.md exactly.
- Run: Once (not background)
- OWNER_TAG: sprint-planner-001

### Current State:
- Sprint: 0 - No active sprint - `awaiting_planning`
- Objective progress: 0%
- WIP: builder 0/3, tester 0/2, planner 0/1
- Tasks ready: 0
- Tasks blocked: 0
```

---

### **Step 2: Launch Sprint Planner (Once)**

**User Action:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/sprint-planner.md exactly.
```
**Run in:** Once (not background)

**Sprint Planner Actions:**
1. ASSESS: Reads OBJECTIVE.md, calculates 0% complete
2. DECIDE: Project not complete (0% ‚â† 100%)
3. DECOMPOSE: Identifies Phase 1 - MCP Server Migration as first logical milestone
4. GENERATE Sprint Goal ‚Üí Updates SPRINT_GOAL.md with Sprint 1, status: `planning`
5. GENERATE Backlog ‚Üí Creates 6 tasks (W001-W006) in SPRINT_BACKLOG.md
6. UPDATE Queue ‚Üí Sets all tasks to `needs_plan` in SPRINT_QUEUE.json
7. LOG Decision ‚Üí Logs Sprint 1 creation in SPRINT_LOG.md

**Sprint Planner Outputs:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Sprint Planner Execution Complete

Sprint 1 created: Foundation & MCP Migration (Oct 1-10, 2025)
- 6 tasks created (W001-W006)
- All tasks status: needs_plan
- Sprint status: planning
- Ready for Planner agent to detail tasks
```

---

### **Step 3: Negotiator Auto-Detects Sprint 1 (Background)**

**Negotiator Re-checks (automatic in background):**
- Reads SPRINT_GOAL.md ‚Üí Sprint 1 exists, status: `planning`
- Reads SPRINT_QUEUE.json ‚Üí 6 tasks with status: `needs_plan`
- WIP limits: planner 0/1 (capacity available)

**Negotiator Outputs:**
```markdown
## Coordination Status ‚Äî Sprint 1

### Actions Needed:

‚ö†Ô∏è LAUNCH AGENT: Planner
- Reason: Sprint 1 has 6 tasks needing detailed plans (W001-W006 all "needs_plan"). Planner capacity: 0/1 available.
- Command: Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
           Run .oodatcaa/prompts/planner.md exactly.
- Run: Once (not background)
- OWNER_TAG: planner-A

### Current State:
- Sprint: 1 - Foundation & MCP Migration - `planning`
- Objective progress: 0% ‚Üí 25% (projected)
- WIP: planner 0/1, builder 0/3, tester 0/2
- Tasks ready: 0 (all need planning)
- Tasks blocked: 0
- Tasks needing plan: 6 (W001-W006)
```

---

### **Step 4: Launch Planner (Once)**

**User Action:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/planner.md exactly.
```
**Run in:** Once (not background)

**Planner Actions:**
1. PICK WORK: Selects W001 (highest priority, needs_plan)
2. OBSERVE/ORIENT: Analyzes repo structure, dependencies
3. Creates AGENT_PLAN.md with detailed implementation steps for W001
4. Creates TEST_PLAN.md with exact test commands
5. Updates SPRINT_QUEUE.json:
   - W001-S01: status ‚Üí `ready` (first step ready for Builder)
   - W001-S02: status ‚Üí `blocked` (depends on S01)
   - Adds tester task: `blocked` (depends on builder steps)
6. Updates SPRINT_PLAN.md with assignments
7. Logs in AGENT_LOG.md

**Planner Outputs:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Planner Execution Complete

Task W001 detailed:
- Created 2 builder steps (W001-S01, W001-S02)
- Created test tasks (blocked until builder completes)
- W001-S01 status: ready (available for Builder)
- Updated AGENT_PLAN.md with full implementation details
```

---

### **Step 5: Negotiator Detects Ready Tasks (Background)**

**Negotiator Re-checks:**
- Reads SPRINT_QUEUE.json ‚Üí W001-S01 status: `ready`
- WIP limits: builder 0/3 (capacity available)
- No builder agents running

**Negotiator Outputs:**
```markdown
## Coordination Status ‚Äî Sprint 1

### Actions Needed:

‚ö†Ô∏è LAUNCH AGENT: Builder
- Reason: Task W001-S01 is ready for implementation. Builder capacity: 0/3 available.
- Command: Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
           Run .oodatcaa/prompts/builder.md exactly.
- Run: Once (not background)
- OWNER_TAG: builder-A

### Current State:
- Sprint: 1 - Foundation & MCP Migration - `in_progress`
- Objective progress: 0% ‚Üí 25% (projected)
- WIP: planner 1/1 (complete), builder 0/3, tester 0/2
- Tasks ready: 1 (W001-S01)
- Tasks blocked: 5
- Recent activity: Planner detailed W001
```

---

### **Step 6: And So On...**

The cycle continues:
- **Builder** completes W001-S01 ‚Üí Updates task to `awaiting_test`
- **Negotiator** detects `awaiting_test` ‚Üí Tells you to launch **Tester**
- **Tester** validates ‚Üí Updates task to `done`
- **Negotiator** detects more `ready` tasks ‚Üí Tells you to launch more **Builders**
- Process continues until all Sprint 1 exit criteria are met
- **Negotiator** detects sprint complete ‚Üí Tells you to launch **Sprint Planner** again
- **Sprint Planner** creates Sprint 2 ‚Üí Cycle repeats

## üéØ Key Success Factors

### **1. Clear End-of-Response Instructions ‚úÖ**
Every agent response ends with:
```markdown
### Actions Needed:

‚ö†Ô∏è LAUNCH AGENT: <Role>
- Reason: <clear explanation>
- Command: Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
           Run .oodatcaa/prompts/<role>.md exactly.
- Run: [Once (not background) | In background]
```

### **2. Background Negotiator Detection ‚úÖ**
- Negotiator runs continuously in background (1-minute heartbeat)
- Automatically detects file changes (SPRINT_GOAL.md, SPRINT_QUEUE.json)
- Re-evaluates and provides new instructions when state changes
- Always shows instructions at END of response
- Quick response time: checks every 60 seconds for updates

### **3. State Detection Chain ‚úÖ**
1. **No Sprint** ‚Üí Launch Sprint Planner
2. **Sprint Created, Tasks Need Plan** ‚Üí Launch Planner
3. **Tasks Ready** ‚Üí Launch Builder
4. **Tasks Awaiting Test** ‚Üí Launch Tester
5. **Tasks Done, Sprint Complete** ‚Üí Launch Sprint Planner (next sprint)

### **4. File-Based Coordination ‚úÖ**
- SPRINT_GOAL.md: Sprint status and exit criteria
- SPRINT_QUEUE.json: Task statuses (needs_plan, ready, in_progress, awaiting_test, done)
- AGENT_LOG.md: Activity history
- SPRINT_LOG.md: Sprint decisions and heartbeats

---

## ‚úÖ Workflow Validation: PASSED

**The process WILL work correctly because:**

1. ‚úÖ Negotiator clearly outputs "LAUNCH AGENT: <Role>" at end of each response
2. ‚úÖ Each agent updates specific files that Negotiator monitors
3. ‚úÖ Negotiator automatically re-evaluates when files change
4. ‚úÖ Clear state transitions trigger specific next actions
5. ‚úÖ User always knows exactly what to do next (launch which agent, how to run it)
6. ‚úÖ Background mode keeps Negotiator continuously monitoring
7. ‚úÖ File-based state prevents lost coordination

**Potential Issues Addressed:**
- ‚ùå Background agent doesn't update: User can manually launch next agent (instructions are clear)
- ‚ùå File conflicts: Agents use locks (.locks/) to prevent conflicts
- ‚ùå Stuck agents: Lease system (.leases/) with TTL allows Negotiator to detect and recover
