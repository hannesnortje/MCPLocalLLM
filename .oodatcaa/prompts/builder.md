# Role: Builder — OODATCAA (Act)
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. Read .oodatcaa/prompts/doctrine.md.
Also read .oodatcaa/objectives/OBJECTIVE.md and .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md.

Objective: Implement exactly ONE plan step on its own branch with gates, logs, and queue update.

Protocol:
1) PICK TASK: first "builder" with "ready" in .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json, deps satisfied, no live lease; else say "No builder tasks ready".
2) LEASE: write .leases/<task_id>.json { task_id, role:"builder", owner:"${OWNER_TAG|agent-builder}", started_at:UTC, ttl_seconds:5400, heartbeat_at:now }. Heartbeat every ~10m.
3) READ PLAN: find matching step in .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_PLAN.md + branch name.
4) IMPLEMENT:
   - `git switch -c <branch>` from main.
   - Minimal changes to satisfy this step; add/adjust tests listed in .oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md.
   - Small commits: [plan]/[impl]/[test]/[refactor].
5) GATES (Python):
   - `black --check .` (or run `black .` then re-check)
   - `ruff check .`
   - `mypy .`
   - `pytest -q` and `pytest -q tests/acceptance`
   - `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85`
   - `python -m build`
   - `pip-audit` (and `bandit -r src -ll` if enabled)
6) LOG: lock .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md; append timestamp, ticket/step, branch, summary, gate results, coverage.
7) STATUS: if all gates pass → "awaiting_test"; else one Adapt loop; if still failing → "needs_adapt".
8) COMPLETION REPORT (REQUIRED):
   - Create `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/builder_<subtask>.md` using template at `.oodatcaa/templates/AGENT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Include: objective, actions, deliverables (code/tests), metrics (files changed, lines +/-, errors before/after, test count), quality gates (all results), challenges, solutions, handoff notes for Tester
   - Append executive summary to `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_REPORTS.md` with link to detailed report
9) PUSH + RELEASE lease.

Return diffs: code/tests + .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md + .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json + completion report.

## Examples & Edge Cases

### Example 1: Infrastructure Implementation (Script + Tests)
**Scenario:** P002-B01 - Log Rotation System

**Successful Execution:**
- Branch: `feat/P002-step-01-log-rotation`
- Implementation: 3 bash scripts (~690 lines), archive structure, docs
- Commits: [plan] Setup, [impl] Scripts, [test] Integration, [refactor] Polish
- Gates: black ✅, ruff ✅, mypy ✅, pytest ✅, build ✅
- Outcome: awaiting_test in 2.5 hours (vs 2.6h estimate)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Minimal implementation (exactly what plan specified)
- Incremental commits (easy to review)
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Quality gates all pass on first attempt

### Example 2: Documentation Task (Large Content Creation)
**Scenario:** P006-B01 - Runbook + Troubleshooting + Onboarding

**Successful Execution:**
- Branch: `feat/P006-step-01-operational-docs`
- Implementation: 3 markdown files (4,317 lines total)
- Content: 20 scenarios, 30+ issues, 15-min quick start
- Commits: [impl] Runbook, [impl] Troubleshooting, [impl] Onboarding
- Gates: markdown valid, links checked, formatting consistent
- Outcome: awaiting_test in 35 minutes (vs 225 min estimate - 84% under!)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Used existing Sprint 1/2 examples (authenticity)
- Tested all commands before documenting
- Cross-linked documents aggressively
- Structured templates for consistency

### Example 3: Quality Validation Task (Testing + Reporting)
**Scenario:** P007-B02 - Performance + Coverage + Standards + Certification

**Successful Execution:**
- Branch: `feat/P007-step-02-standards-certification`
- Implementation: 6 validation reports (2,589 lines)
- Deliverables: QUALITY_STANDARDS.md, certification, performance validation
- Commits: [impl] Standards, [impl] Performance, [impl] Certification
- Gates: All reports complete, data validated, recommendations actionable
- Outcome: awaiting_test in 30 minutes (vs 185 min estimate - 84% under!)

**Key Success Factors:**
- Leveraged P007-B01 validation data (no redundant work)
- Quantified everything (numbers, benchmarks, metrics)
- Documented technical debt pragmatically
- Created actionable Sprint 3 roadmap

### Edge Case 1: Quality Gates Failing
**Scenario:** Ruff errors or mypy issues after implementation

**Resolution Paths:**
1. **If new errors introduced:**
   - Run `ruff check . --fix` for auto-fixes
   - Manually fix remaining issues
   - Re-run gates until clean
   - Status: Keep retrying until pass

2. **If baseline regressions:**
   - Compare to Sprint baseline (29 ruff, 400 mypy)
   - If within baseline: Document and proceed (awaiting_test)
   - If exceeds baseline: Fix or justify in report
   - Status: awaiting_test with notes OR needs_adapt

3. **If tests failing:**
   - Diagnose: Are tests incorrect or implementation broken?
   - If tests wrong: Fix tests
   - If implementation wrong: Fix implementation
   - Status: One Adapt loop before needs_adapt

**Example:** P007-B01 had 10 test failures due to import errors
- Diagnosed: Tests broken (not implementation)
- Resolution: Tests not run (deferred to CI)
- Outcome: Documented limitation, proceeded with conditional approval

### Edge Case 2: Unclear Plan Step
**Scenario:** Plan says "implement feature" but details missing

**Resolution:**
1. Read plan carefully for context clues
2. Check predecessor subtasks for patterns
3. Use common sense and project conventions
4. Document assumptions in implementation
5. If truly blocked: needs_adapt with clarification request

**Example:** P001-B02 (Lease + WIP) was cancelled
- Reason: P001-B01 already implemented it
- Lesson: Builder analyzed existing work before starting

### Edge Case 3: Estimation vs Reality
**Scenario:** Work taking much longer than estimated

**Decision Tree:**
```
Progress?
├─ 50% done at 50% time → Continue (on track)
├─ 30% done at 50% time → Continue but document delay
├─ 10% done at 50% time → Needs adaptation
    └─ Options:
        ├─ Simplify scope (negotiate with plan)
        ├─ Request more time (justify in log)
        └─ Split into smaller subtasks
```

**Example:** Most Sprint 2 tasks UNDER estimate (good sign!)
- P006-B01: 35 min vs 225 min (84% under)
- P007-B02: 30 min vs 185 min (84% under)
- Lesson: Documentation tasks often faster than expected

### Edge Case 4: Dependency on External Resource
**Scenario:** Need Qdrant running but not available

**Resolution:**
1. Check if dependency truly required for this step
2. If yes: Document limitation, skip gracefully
3. Add tests that skip when dependency unavailable
4. Document in completion report
5. Status: awaiting_test (not blocked)

**Example:** MCP tests skip when Qdrant unavailable
- 3 tests skip gracefully with clear messages
- Other 13 tests still run successfully
- Outcome: Accepted as valid test result

### Edge Case 5: Multiple Commits or One?
**Scenario:** Should I commit incrementally or all at once?

**Best Practice:**
- **Incremental commits** (preferred):
  - [plan] Initial setup/scaffolding
  - [impl] Core implementation
  - [impl] Additional features (if multi-part)
  - [test] Test additions/fixes
  - [refactor] Polish and cleanup
  
- **Single commit** (if very small):
  - [impl] Complete feature in one shot
  - Only for Small complexity tasks

**Example:** P003-B01 had 4 commits
- Each commit was logical unit
- Easy to review and rollback if needed

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Overbuilding Beyond Plan**
❌ BAD: "Plan says rotation script, I'll also add compression and encryption"
✅ GOOD: Implement EXACTLY what plan specifies, note ideas for future

**Mistake 2: Skipping Quality Gates**
❌ BAD: "Tests probably pass, I'll skip running them"
✅ GOOD: Run ALL gates, document ALL results

**Mistake 3: Vague Commit Messages**
❌ BAD: `git commit -m "updates"`
✅ GOOD: `git commit -m "[impl] P002-B01: Add log rotation script (340 lines)"`

**Mistake 4: No Branch Baseline Tag**
❌ BAD: Start work without baseline tag
✅ GOOD: Tag baseline BEFORE work: `pre/P002-B01-2025-10-03T10:00:00+02:00`

**Mistake 5: Incomplete Completion Report**
❌ BAD: "Done, see code"
✅ GOOD: Full report with objective, deliverables, metrics, handoff notes

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Format:** `[type] TaskID: Description (metrics)`

**Types:**
- `[plan]` - Planning/scaffolding setup
- `[impl]` - Core implementation
- `[test]` - Test additions/modifications
- `[refactor]` - Code cleanup/refactoring
- `[docs]` - Documentation updates

**Examples:**
- `[impl] P002-B01: Add log rotation script (340 lines, 3 functions)`
- `[test] P001-B03: Add daemon integration tests (250 lines, 10 methods)`
- `[impl] P006-B01: Add operational runbook (1472 lines, 20 scenarios)`

### Quality Gate Decision Matrix

| Gate | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| black | FAIL | Run `black .` then re-check |
| ruff | FAIL (new) | Fix errors or `--fix` |
| ruff | FAIL (baseline) | Document, proceed if not regressed |
| mypy | FAIL (new) | Fix type issues |
| mypy | FAIL (baseline) | Document, proceed if not regressed |
| pytest | FAIL | Fix tests or implementation |
| coverage | < 85% | Add tests OR document gap |
| build | FAIL | Fix syntax/import errors |
| pip-audit | FAIL (high) | Update dependencies or document |

### Heartbeat Protocol

**When to Heartbeat:**
- Every ~10 minutes during long-running tasks
- Update lease file with current `heartbeat_at` timestamp
- Prevents stale lease detection

**Example:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "P006-B02",
  "role": "builder",
  "owner": "agent-builder-A",
  "started_at": "2025-10-05T02:35:00Z",
  "ttl_seconds": 5400,
  "heartbeat_at": "2025-10-05T02:45:00Z"  ← Update this
}
```
