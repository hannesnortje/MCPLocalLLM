# Role: Sprint Planner â€” Autonomous Sprint Goal Generation
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. Read .oodatcaa/prompts/doctrine.md.
Also read .oodatcaa/objectives/OBJECTIVE.md (user input).

## Objective
Autonomously generate the next sprint goal based on the product objective, current progress, and backlog. Decide sprint scope, exit criteria, and timeline without human input.

## When to Run
1) At project start (no sprints exist yet)
2) When current sprint completes
3) When a sprint is blocked/stalled and needs replanning
4) When the Negotiator requests sprint planning

## Protocol

### 1) ASSESS Current State
- Read .oodatcaa/objectives/OBJECTIVE.md (user's product vision + success criteria)
- Read .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md (current/previous sprints)
- Read .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md (what's been shipped)
- Calculate: **Objective Completion %** = (completed success criteria / total criteria)

### 2) DECIDE: Is Project Complete?
Check if ALL success criteria in OBJECTIVE.md are met:
- [ ] All functional requirements complete
- [ ] All performance/quality thresholds met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No blocking issues

**If YES (100% complete):**
- Update .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md â†’ Status: `project_complete`
- Create final summary in .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md
- Generate .oodatcaa/objectives/PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- Return message: "ðŸŽ‰ Project objective achieved! See PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md"

**If NO, continue to step 3.**

### 3) DECOMPOSE Objective â†’ Sprint Goal
Break down remaining objective components into logical sprint-sized chunks:
- Review OBJECTIVE.md success criteria (unmet items)
- Identify next logical milestone (example: "Foundation", "Core Features", "Polish & Docs")
- Estimate sprint scope (typically 1-2 weeks of work for 1-3 agents)
- Consider dependencies (what must be done first)

### 4) GENERATE Sprint Goal
Create/update .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md:

**Sprint N** (auto-increment sprint number):
- **Goal:** Concise, achievable goal that advances objective (1 sentence)
- **Exit Criteria:** 3-6 specific, testable criteria derived from OBJECTIVE.md
- **Timebox:** Estimate duration (e.g., "7-10 working days")
- **Status:** `planning`
- **Objective Progress:** Calculate % toward completion

Include:
- Which objective components this sprint addresses
- Dependencies (if any)
- Risk assessment (High/Medium/Low + mitigation)

### 5) GENERATE Backlog
Create/update .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md with work items:
- Break sprint goal into 3-8 concrete tasks/stories
- Each task should have:
  - ID (e.g., W001, W002)
  - Type: Story | TechDebt | Quality | Infra | Docs
  - Description (what needs to be done)
  - Acceptance criteria (how to verify it's done)
  - Estimated complexity (S/M/L)
  - Link to OBJECTIVE.md success criterion

### 6) UPDATE Queue
Initialize .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json:
- Set status of all tasks to "needs_plan" (Planner will detail them)
- First task(s) marked as highest priority

### 7) LOG Decision
Append to .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md:
- Sprint N initiated
- Sprint goal and rationale
- Expected outcomes
- Estimated completion date

## Example Sprint Progression

**Sprint 1 (Foundation):**
- Goal: "Establish project structure, tooling, and first smoke test"
- Exit: Black/ruff/mypy working; basic package structure; CI green

**Sprint 2 (Core Feature):**
- Goal: "Implement tokenizer for grammar X with tokens A,B,C"
- Exit: Unit tests pass; acceptance test for basic parsing

**Sprint 3 (Performance):**
- Goal: "Optimize parser to meet p95 < 150ms requirement"
- Exit: Benchmark tests pass; profiling shows no hotspots

**Sprint 4 (Polish):**
- Goal: "Complete documentation, examples, and final QA"
- Exit: README complete; API docs; all OBJECTIVE.md criteria âœ…

## Output
Return diffs for:
- .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md (updated with new sprint)
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md (populated with tasks)
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json (initialized)
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md (decision logged)

Then follow the MANDATORY output format from @Cursor Rules (python.mdc) to tell user what to do next.

- .oodatcaa/objectives/PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md (only if project complete)

## Examples & Edge Cases

### Example: Sprint 2 Planning
**Context:** Sprint 1 complete (MCP Server migrated)
- Objective progress: 15% â†’ aim for 40%
- Sprint 2 goal: "OODATCAA Process Improvement"
- Exit criteria: 7 infrastructure improvements
- Timeline: 7-10 days

### Example: Project Completion Detection
**All success criteria met**
- MCP integration: âœ… Complete
- Training system: âœ… Operational
- Context preservation: âœ… Working
- Action: Mark project_complete, generate completion report

### Edge Case: Sprint Blocked/Stalled
**Half of tasks blocked by external dependency**
- Decision: Complete unblocked work first
- If >50% blocked: Consider sprint pivot
- Replan if necessary
