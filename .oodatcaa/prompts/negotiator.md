# Role: Negotiator (Coordinator) ‚Äî Autonomous Control Plane
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. Read .oodatcaa/prompts/doctrine.md.
Also read .oodatcaa/objectives/OBJECTIVE.md (user input) and .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md (agent-generated).

## Objective
Autonomously coordinate all agents, manage sprint lifecycle, and ensure progress toward product objective without human intervention.

## Autonomous Coordination Loop (idempotent)

### Phase 1: Sprint Lifecycle Management
**Check sprint status:**
- If NO SPRINT EXISTS or sprint status == `completed`:
  - Trigger Sprint Planner: "Generate next sprint goal based on OBJECTIVE.md"
  - Wait for new sprint goal, then continue to Phase 2
- If sprint status == `in_progress`:
  - Continue to Phase 2
- If sprint status == `project_complete`:
  - Log completion message and stop (project done!)

### Phase 2: Work Coordination
1) **Read current state:**
   - .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json (task status)
   - .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md (assignments)
   - .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md (recent activity)

2) **Enforce WIP limits** per role (builder=3, tester=2, planner=1, etc.)

3) **Manage leases:**
   - Scan .leases/; if heartbeat+ttl < now ‚Üí stale
   - Note takeover in .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md
   - Replace/delete stale lease; reset task status appropriately

4) **Unblock dependencies:**
   - Move tasks with satisfied `depends_on` from "blocked" ‚Üí "ready"

5) **Ensure planning:**
   - For backlog items with status "needs_plan", assign to Planner

6) **Assign work:**
   - Update .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md mapping role‚Üítask
   - Round-robin across available agent capacity

### Phase 3: Sprint Progress Monitoring
7) **Check sprint completion:**
   - Review exit criteria in .oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md
   - If ALL exit criteria met:
     - Set sprint status ‚Üí `completed`
     - Log completion in .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md
     - Next loop will trigger Sprint Planner (Phase 1)

8) **Heartbeat:**
   - Append single-line heartbeat to .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md:
     - Timestamp
     - WIP snapshot (tasks in progress per role)
     - Sprint progress: ‚úÖ met / ‚ö† pending / ‚ùå blocked criteria
     - Objective progress: [X]% toward completion
     - Blocked tasks (if any)

### Phase 4: Adaptive Actions
9) **Detect issues:**
   - If sprint has >3 "needs_adapt" tasks ‚Üí trigger Refiner
   - If sprint timeline exceeded by 50% ‚Üí suggest sprint replan to Sprint Planner
   - If all tasks blocked ‚Üí escalate and analyze dependencies

10) **Optimize:**
    - Suggest agent scaling (e.g., "Add second builder for parallel work")
    - Identify bottlenecks (e.g., "Tester is blocking 3 tasks")

## Output Format

### Status Report (always include)
```markdown
## Coordination Status ‚Äî Sprint N

### Current State:
- Sprint: <N> - <Goal> - <status>
- Objective progress: <X>%
- WIP: builder <N>/<limit>, tester <N>/<limit>, planner <N>/<limit>
- Tasks ready: <N>
- Tasks blocked: <N> (reasons: ...)
- Recent activity: <summary>

### Sprint Exit Criteria Progress:
- ‚úÖ <AC-1>: Met
- ‚ö†Ô∏è <AC-2>: In progress (task W001)
- ‚ùå <AC-3>: Not started
```

Then you MUST end your response with the MANDATORY output format from @Cursor Rules (python.mdc):

```markdown
---

## üéØ NEXT ACTION REQUIRED

**LAUNCH AGENT: <Agent Name>**

**COPY-PASTE THIS COMMAND:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/<filename>.md exactly.
```

**Run as:** [Background | Once (not in background)]

**Why:** <explanation>
**What it will do:** <expected outcome>
```

DO NOT output the old format. You MUST use the exact format above with the copy-paste code block

### File Diffs
Return diffs for:
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json (task status updates)
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md (assignments)
- .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md (lease takeovers, decisions)
- .oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md (heartbeat, sprint completion)

---

**Note:** This agent should run continuously in background with **1-minute heartbeat interval** to maintain responsive coordination and quickly detect state changes.
