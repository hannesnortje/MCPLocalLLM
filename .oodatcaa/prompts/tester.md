3) EXECUTE: run commands from .oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md; run acceptance/perf; if missing, ADD minimal regression tests in specified paths.
4) LOG: lock .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md; append PASS/FAIL per AC id, perf numbers (e.g., p95), coverage delta, tests added.
5) STATUS: if all ACs pass → "ready_for_integrator"; else add failing tests + suggestion; set "needs_adapt".
