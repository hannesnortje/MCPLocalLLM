## Log Entries

### 2025-10-01T00:00:00Z | Negotiator | Sprint Lifecycle Check
**Action:** Checked sprint status - NO SPRINT EXISTS  
**Outcome:** No active sprint found. SPRINT_GOAL.md indicates "Awaiting First Sprint Planning"  
**Decision:** Triggering Sprint Planner to generate first sprint goal based on OBJECTIVE.md  
**Next Steps:** Sprint Planner will analyze OBJECTIVE.md and create Sprint 1 with exit criteria

### 2025-10-01T00:15:00Z | Sprint Planner | Generate Sprint 1
**Action:** Analyzed OBJECTIVE.md and decomposed into first sprint goal  
**Outcome:** Created Sprint 1: MCP Server Foundation (7-10 days)  
- **Goal:** Migrate MCP server from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to establish infrastructure
- **Exit Criteria:** 6 specific criteria covering migration, integration, testing, and documentation
- **Backlog:** 8 work items (W001-W008) with dependencies mapped
- **Objective Progress:** 0% → ~15% target (Foundation milestone)  
**Rationale:** Following OBJECTIVE.md Phase 1 Implementation Strategy. MCP infrastructure is critical foundation for all subsequent training, context preservation, and daily learning features.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md` → Sprint 1 details
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md` → 8 work items created
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → Task queue initialized
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md` → Sprint 1 logged  
**Next Steps:** Negotiator should assign W001 (Analyze MCP Source) to Planner for detailed planning

### 2025-10-01T00:30:00Z | Negotiator | Work Coordination
**Action:** Phase 2 coordination - Work assignment  
**Outcome:** Assigned W001 to Planner agent  
- **Task:** W001 - Analyze MCP Source Structure
- **Agent:** Planner
- **Status:** needs_plan → planning
- **WIP Status:** planner 1/1 (at capacity), builder 0/3, tester 0/2
- **Dependencies:** None (ready to start)
- **Remaining Ready:** 0 tasks (all others blocked by W001)  
**Rationale:** W001 is the critical path entry point with no dependencies. Must analyze source before migration can proceed. Sequential planning ensures proper understanding before execution.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → W001 status updated, agent assigned
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Assignment recorded  
**Next Steps:** Planner agent will create detailed AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md for W001

### 2025-10-01T16:57:36+02:00 | Planner | W001 Planning Complete
**Action:** Created detailed implementation plan for W001 (Analyze MCP Source Structure)  
**Outcome:** AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md completed
- **Plan Version:** 1.0
- **Implementation Steps:** 7 steps organized into 3 builder tasks (B01, B02, B03) + 1 tester task (T01)
- **Artifacts Planned:** 7 analysis documents in `.oodatcaa/work/analysis/W001/`
- **Approach:** Selective copy with explicit inclusion list (Alternative 2 chosen)
- **Key Findings:**
  - MCP source uses Poetry, needs conversion to setuptools
  - UI components (PySide6, websockets) identified for exclusion
  - No conflicts expected with existing `mdnotes` module
  - OODATCAA preservation strategy: explicit exclusion in copy commands
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 ACs defined (7 functional + 3 non-functional)
- **Branch:** `feat/W001-step-01-analyze-source`  
**Rationale:** Systematic analysis minimizes migration risks. Selective copy approach prevents OODATCAA file conflicts and reduces project bloat. Builder tasks broken down for parallel execution potential.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_PLAN.md` → Detailed 7-step implementation plan created
- `.oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md` → Test strategy and AC verification procedures
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → Added W001-B01 (ready), W001-B02 (blocked), W001-B03 (blocked), W001-T01 (blocked)
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Updated with implementation plan and next steps
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md` → This entry  
**Next Steps:** Negotiator should assign W001-B01 to Builder agent for execution of Steps 1-2 (structure analysis + essential components)

   - Captured complete MCP source tree: 23 directories, 161 files
   - Created comprehensive inventory: `.oodatcaa/work/analysis/W001/mcp_structure_inventory.md`
   - Categorized all components: ESSENTIAL (67), EXCLUDE (40+), OPTIONAL (35)
   - Analyzed all directories: `src/`, `policy/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, root files

2. **Step 2 - Essential Components Documentation**
   - Created inclusion strategy document: `.oodatcaa/work/analysis/W001/essential_components.md`
   - Documented 67 essential files with purpose and rationale
   - Identified UI exclusions: `src/ui/` directory (~20 files), PySide6 dependency
   - Confirmed no conflicts with existing `mdnotes` module
   - Defined OODATCAA preservation strategy (explicit exclusion in copy commands)

**Key Findings:**
- **Core MCP Components**: 42 files in `src/` (server, handlers, memory, tools, prompts)
- **Policy System**: 4 markdown files defining governance rules
- **UI System (EXCLUDED)**: Entire `src/ui/` directory + PySide6/websockets dependencies
- **Dependencies**: 9 core (mcp, qdrant-client, sentence-transformers, etc.) + 2 dev (pytest-asyncio, types-markdown)
