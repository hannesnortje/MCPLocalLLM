## Log Entries

### 2025-10-01T00:00:00Z | Negotiator | Sprint Lifecycle Check
**Action:** Checked sprint status - NO SPRINT EXISTS  
**Outcome:** No active sprint found. SPRINT_GOAL.md indicates "Awaiting First Sprint Planning"  
**Decision:** Triggering Sprint Planner to generate first sprint goal based on OBJECTIVE.md  
**Next Steps:** Sprint Planner will analyze OBJECTIVE.md and create Sprint 1 with exit criteria

### 2025-10-01T00:15:00Z | Sprint Planner | Generate Sprint 1
**Action:** Analyzed OBJECTIVE.md and decomposed into first sprint goal  
**Outcome:** Created Sprint 1: MCP Server Foundation (7-10 days)  
- **Goal:** Migrate MCP server from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to establish infrastructure
- **Exit Criteria:** 6 specific criteria covering migration, integration, testing, and documentation
- **Backlog:** 8 work items (W001-W008) with dependencies mapped
- **Objective Progress:** 0% → ~15% target (Foundation milestone)  
**Rationale:** Following OBJECTIVE.md Phase 1 Implementation Strategy. MCP infrastructure is critical foundation for all subsequent training, context preservation, and daily learning features.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md` → Sprint 1 details
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md` → 8 work items created
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → Task queue initialized
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md` → Sprint 1 logged  
**Next Steps:** Negotiator should assign W001 (Analyze MCP Source) to Planner for detailed planning

### 2025-10-01T00:30:00Z | Negotiator | Work Coordination
**Action:** Phase 2 coordination - Work assignment  
**Outcome:** Assigned W001 to Planner agent  
- **Task:** W001 - Analyze MCP Source Structure
- **Agent:** Planner
- **Status:** needs_plan → planning
- **WIP Status:** planner 1/1 (at capacity), builder 0/3, tester 0/2
- **Dependencies:** None (ready to start)
- **Remaining Ready:** 0 tasks (all others blocked by W001)  
**Rationale:** W001 is the critical path entry point with no dependencies. Must analyze source before migration can proceed. Sequential planning ensures proper understanding before execution.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → W001 status updated, agent assigned
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Assignment recorded  
**Next Steps:** Planner agent will create detailed AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md for W001

### 2025-10-01T16:57:36+02:00 | Planner | W001 Planning Complete
**Action:** Created detailed implementation plan for W001 (Analyze MCP Source Structure)  
**Outcome:** AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md completed
- **Plan Version:** 1.0
- **Implementation Steps:** 7 steps organized into 3 builder tasks (B01, B02, B03) + 1 tester task (T01)
- **Artifacts Planned:** 7 analysis documents in `.oodatcaa/work/analysis/W001/`
- **Approach:** Selective copy with explicit inclusion list (Alternative 2 chosen)
- **Key Findings:**
  - MCP source uses Poetry, needs conversion to setuptools
  - UI components (PySide6, websockets) identified for exclusion
  - No conflicts expected with existing `mdnotes` module
  - OODATCAA preservation strategy: explicit exclusion in copy commands
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 ACs defined (7 functional + 3 non-functional)
- **Branch:** `feat/W001-step-01-analyze-source`  
**Rationale:** Systematic analysis minimizes migration risks. Selective copy approach prevents OODATCAA file conflicts and reduces project bloat. Builder tasks broken down for parallel execution potential.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_PLAN.md` → Detailed 7-step implementation plan created
- `.oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md` → Test strategy and AC verification procedures

### 2025-10-02T10:30:00+02:00 | Planner | W002 Planning Complete
**Action:** Created detailed implementation plan for W002 (Execute MCP Server Migration)  
**Outcome:** AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md completed
- **Plan Version:** 1.0
- **Implementation Steps:** 8 steps organized into 3 builder tasks (B01, B02, B03) + 1 tester task (T01)
- **Migration Strategy:** Selective copy per W001 migration checklist (24 steps)
- **Files to Copy:** 67 essential MCP files (src/mcp/, policy/, docs/mcp/, scripts/, infrastructure)
- **Protected Areas:** `.oodatcaa/` and `src/mdnotes/` with verification steps and rollback triggers
- **Key Approach:**
  - **Step 1-3 (W002-B01):** Pre-migration setup + baseline tag + copy core MCP files
  - **Step 4-6 (W002-B02):** Config merge + critical verification + commit
  - **Step 7-8 (W002-B03):** Post-migration validation + push
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 ACs defined (7 functional + 3 non-functional)
- **Risk Assessment:** LOW (per W001 analysis, comprehensive protection checks)
- **Rollback Plan:** Baseline tag with 4 trigger conditions (OODATCAA modified, mdnotes modified, tests fail, file count deviation)
- **Branch:** `feat/W002-step-01-copy-mcp-core`  
**Rationale:** W001 analysis provides complete migration strategy with LOW risk. Selective copy approach minimizes conflicts. Critical protection checks prevent OODATCAA/mdnotes damage. Builder tasks sequenced for verification at each phase.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_PLAN.md` → Detailed 8-step implementation plan with 3 builder tasks
- `.oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md` → Test strategy with 10 ACs and protection checks
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → Added W002-B01 (ready), W002-B02 (blocked), W002-B03 (blocked), W002-T01 (blocked)
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Updated with W002 implementation plan and next steps
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md` → This entry  
**Next Steps:** Negotiator should assign W002-B01 to Builder agent for execution of Steps 1-3 (pre-migration setup + baseline + copy core MCP files)

### 2025-10-02T15:00:00+02:00 | Negotiator | Work Coordination Cycle
**Action:** Phase 2 coordination - W003 planning assignment  
**Outcome:** W003 activated for Planner agent  
- **Task:** W003 - Integrate MCP Dependencies (Planning)
- **Agent:** Planner (third story planning in sprint)
- **Status:** needs_plan → planning
- **WIP Status:** planner 1/1 (AT CAPACITY), builder 0/3, tester 0/2, integrator 0/1
- **Dependencies:** W002 satisfied (complete and merged)
- **Remaining Ready:** 0 tasks
- **Blocked:** W004 (awaiting W002 + W003); W005-W008 (by dependency chain)  
**Rationale:** W002 successfully integrated with 61 MCP files migrated. Next critical step is installing MCP dependencies (mcp, qdrant-client, sentence-transformers, etc.) to enable code functionality. W003 has no blocking dependencies and is ready for planning. Cleaned up 2 stale lease files from completed W001 tasks.  
**Lease Maintenance:**
- Removed stale lease: `.leases/W001-B02.json` (W001-B02 completed, lease no longer needed)
- Removed stale lease: `.leases/W001-B03.json` (W001-B03 completed, lease no longer needed)
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → W003 status → planning, agent assigned, metadata updated
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → W003 assignment recorded
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md` → This entry

- `.leases/W001-B02.json` → Removed (stale)
- `.leases/W001-B03.json` → Removed (stale)  
**Next Steps:** Planner agent will create detailed AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md for W003 (install MCP dependencies from W001 analysis)

### 2025-10-02T15:15:00+02:00 | Planner | W003 Planning Complete
**Action:** Created detailed implementation plan for W003 (Integrate MCP Dependencies)  
**Outcome:** AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md completed
- **Plan Version:** 1.0
- **Implementation Steps:** 10 steps organized into 3 builder tasks (B01, B02, B03) + 1 tester task (T01)
- **Dependencies to Add:** 10 MCP production deps + 2 dev deps (per W001 analysis)
- **Installation Size:** ~2.1GB (sentence-transformers brings PyTorch)
- **Key Approach:**
  - **Step 1-5 (W003-B01):** Branch setup + update pyproject.toml with all MCP dependencies and tool configs
  - **Step 6-8 (W003-B02):** Install dependencies (~10-15 min download) + verify all imports work + run quality gates
  - **Step 9-10 (W003-B03):** Commit changes + update documentation
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 ACs defined (7 functional + 3 non-functional)
- **Risk Assessment:** LOW (W001 verified zero conflicts, exact versions provided)
- **Rollback Plan:** Baseline tag with 5 trigger conditions (installation fails, imports fail, tests fail, security issues)
- **Critical Verifications:** Import checks for mcp, qdrant_client, sentence_transformers; existing mdnotes imports; existing tests pass
- **Branch:** `feat/W003-step-01-integrate-dependencies`  
**Rationale:** W001 dependency analysis provides exact version constraints and tool config updates. Zero dependency conflicts identified. Large installation size (~2.1GB) is expected and acceptable for ML training system (per OBJECTIVE). Import verification ensures MCP code becomes functional. Tool config updates (mypy packages, pytest asyncio_mode, ruff known-first-party) minimal and low-risk.  
**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_PLAN.md` → Detailed 10-step implementation plan with 3 builder tasks
- `.oodatcaa/work/TEST_PLAN.md` → Test strategy with 10 ACs and import verification procedures
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` → Added W003-B01 (ready), W003-B02 (blocked), W003-B03 (blocked), W003-T01 (blocked)
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_PLAN.md` → Updated with W003 implementation plan and next steps
- `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_LOG.md` → This entry  
**Next Steps:** Negotiator should assign W003-B01 to Builder agent for execution of Steps 1-5 (update pyproject.toml with MCP dependencies and tool configurations)

### 2025-10-02T15:30:00+02:00 | Negotiator | Work Coordination Cycle

**W003 Complete Achievement Summary:**

**What Was Delivered:**
1. **pyproject.toml Updated (W003-B01):**
   - Added 10 MCP production dependencies (mcp, qdrant-client, sentence-transformers, etc.)
   - Added 2 MCP dev dependencies (pytest-asyncio, types-markdown)
   - Updated Python constraint to >=3.11,<3.13
   - Updated tool configs (mypy, pytest asyncio_mode, ruff known-first-party)
   - Description and keywords updated for MCP integration

2. **Dependencies Installed (W003-B02):**
   - 83 packages installed (~2.3GB)
   - PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128 with CUDA support
   - All NVIDIA CUDA libraries (cudnn, cufft, cublas, cusparse, etc.)
   - Sentence-transformers 2.7.0 for embeddings
   - Qdrant-client 1.15.1 for vector database
   - MCP 1.15.0 protocol library

3. **All Imports Verified (W003-B02):**
   - ✅ mcp, qdrant_client, sentence_transformers
   - ✅ torch, numpy, markdown, beautifulsoup4
   - ✅ aiohttp, aiofiles, pyyaml
   - ✅ mdnotes.core (existing module preserved)

4. **Quality Gates Maintained:**
   - ✅ All formatting checks pass (black)
   - ✅ Existing code type checks pass (mypy src/mdnotes)
   - ✅ All existing tests pass (2/2 smoke + 1/1 acceptance)
   - ✅ Coverage maintained (100% on mdnotes)
   - ✅ Build succeeds (wheel + sdist with both mdnotes and mcp)

**Critical Success Metrics:**
- **Zero regressions:** All existing tests pass
- **Zero import errors:** All MCP dependencies work
- **Zero breaking changes:** mdnotes module fully preserved
