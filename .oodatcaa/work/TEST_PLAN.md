# TEST_PLAN: P005 - Agent Role Assessment & Enhancement

**Task ID:** P005  
**Objective:** SPRINT-2025-002 (OODATCAA Process Improvement)  
**Sprint:** 2  
**Tester:** TBD  
**Created:** 2025-10-03T22:45:00+02:00

---

## Testing Strategy

**Task Type:** Analysis & Documentation (No Code Changes)

**Testing Approach:**
1. **Documentation Completeness:** Verify all required content present
2. **Accuracy Validation:** Cross-check claims against actual agent prompts and Sprint 1/2 reports
3. **Evidence Verification:** Ensure all assessments backed by data
4. **Feasibility Review:** Validate recommendations are actionable
5. **Integration Testing:** Verify cross-links and documentation navigation

**Note:** This is an analytical task with no code implementation. Testing focuses on documentation quality, accuracy, and completeness rather than code quality gates.

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Agent Matrix Accuracy
**Goal:** Verify agent descriptions match actual prompts

**Procedure:**
1. For each agent in AGENT_ROLES_MATRIX.md:
   - Open corresponding prompt file (e.g., `.oodatcaa/prompts/builder.md`)
   - Compare "Purpose" in matrix to "Objective" in prompt
   - Compare "Responsibilities" to protocol steps in prompt
   - Verify Input/Output files match what prompt reads/writes
2. Spot-check at least 5 agents for accuracy

**Expected Result:** Matrix descriptions accurately reflect prompts

---

### Test 2: Workflow Pattern Validation
**Goal:** Verify workflow patterns match Sprint 1/2 execution

**Procedure:**
1. Open `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md`
2. Find a completed task (e.g., W001, P002-B01)
3. Trace agent sequence from SPRINT_LOG entries
4. Compare to workflow patterns in AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md
5. Verify pattern matches actual execution

**Expected Result:** Documented workflows match real Sprint 1/2 execution

---

### Test 3: Gap Analysis Validation
**Goal:** Verify gaps are real (not false positives)

**Procedure:**
1. For each identified gap (e.g., "No Monitor Agent"):
   - Check if current agent set can handle this need
   - Review Sprint 1/2 for instances where gap caused issues
   - Assess if gap is theoretical or practical
2. Verify at least 2 gaps have Sprint 1/2 evidence

**Expected Result:** Identified gaps are real workflow needs, not theoretical

---

### Test 4: Recommendation Feasibility
**Goal:** Verify recommendations are actionable

**Procedure:**
1. For each High Priority recommendation:
   - Estimate effort (can it be done in 1-2 sprints?)
   - Check dependencies (are they available?)
   - Assess disruption risk (will it break existing patterns?)
2. Verify at least 1 recommendation can start in Sprint 3

**Expected Result:** High Priority recommendations are feasible and actionable

## Notes

- **Documentation Quality:** This task produces documentation artifacts, not code. Testing focuses on completeness, accuracy, and evidence-based claims.
- **Sprint 1 Success:** 91.9% completion rate demonstrates current agent system works well. Gap analysis should respect this success.
- **Practical Focus:** Recommendations must be actionable, not theoretical. Prioritization is critical.
- **Evidence Requirement:** Every claim about agent performance must cite Sprint 1/2 data (task IDs, metrics, reports).
