2. **Test Discovery:** Collected 13 integration tests via pytest (4 server + 5 memory + 4 policy)
3. **Code Quality Checks (AC7):** Ran black formatting, ruff linting on test files
4. **Regression Testing (AC4):** Executed smoke tests to verify zero regressions
5. **Integration Testing (AC1-3):** Ran full MCP integration test suite
6. **Performance Validation (AC6):** Measured test execution time
7. **Full Suite Validation:** Ran complete test suite (smoke + integration + acceptance)
8. **Documentation Check (AC10):** Verified module docstrings exist in all test files
9. **Build Validation (AC7):** Verified package builds successfully
10. **Security Audit (AC7):** Ran pip-audit for vulnerability check

---

## Deliverables

- **Quality Gates Report:** All gates pass (black, ruff, pytest, build, security)
- **Performance Metrics:** 18.04s execution time (39.9% faster than 30s target)
- **Regression Report:** Zero regressions confirmed (2/2 smoke tests pass)
- **Completion Report:** This document + AGENT_LOG.md entry

---

## Metrics

- **Integration Tests:** 10 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed
- **Full Test Suite:** 13 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed, 9 warnings
- **Test Execution Time:** 18.04s (< 30s target ✅)
- **Performance:** 39.9% faster than threshold
- **Smoke Tests:** 2/2 passed (zero regressions)

### Test Breakdown
- **Server Initialization Tests (AC1):** 4/4 passed ✅
- **Memory CRUD Tests (AC2):** 2 passed, 3 skipped (update/delete tools not implemented - expected)
- **Policy System Tests (AC3):** 4/4 passed ✅
- **Regression Tests (AC4):** 2/2 passed ✅

### Quality Gates

- **Ruff Linting:** ✅ Pass (0 errors)
- **Pytest:** ✅ Pass (13/16 tests, 3 skipped)
- **Build:** ✅ Pass (mdnotes-0.1.0.tar.gz + wheel)
- **Security:** ✅ Pass (1 non-blocking pip vulnerability)

### Coverage
- **Total Tests:** 16 (13 integration + 2 smoke + 1 acceptance placeholder)
- **Test Organization:** tests/mcp/ with proper structure ✅
- **Docstrings:** All test modules have docstrings ✅

---

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 1:** Expected 12 integration tests (per TEST_PLAN), found 13
   - **Root Cause:** W006-B02 implemented 4 policy tests instead of planned 3
   - **Impact:** None - additional test coverage is beneficial

2. **Challenge 2:** 3 memory CRUD tests skipping (read, update, delete)
   - **Root Cause:** Tools not yet implemented in MCP server
   - **Impact:** Expected behavior - graceful degradation working correctly

---

## Solutions

1. **Solution to Challenge 1:** Accepted 13 tests as superior to planned 12 tests - more coverage is better
2. **Solution to Challenge 2:** Verified skip behavior is graceful and documented - AC2 still passes (2/2 implemented operations work)

---

## Quality Gates

**All Quality Gates Pass ✅**

- **Black Formatting:** ✅ Pass - All 5 test files formatted correctly
- **Ruff Linting:** ✅ Pass - 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **Mypy Type Checking:** ⏭️ Skipped (optional for tests per TEST_PLAN)
- **Pytest Smoke Tests:** ✅ Pass - 2/2 passing (test_greets, test_package_import)
- **Pytest Integration Tests:** ✅ Pass - 10/10 non-skipped tests passing
- **Pytest Full Suite:** ✅ Pass - 13/16 passing (3 skipped, 9 warnings)
- **Build (python -m build):** ✅ Pass - mdnotes-0.1.0 built successfully
- **Security (pip-audit):** ✅ Pass - 1 non-blocking pip vulnerability (acceptable)
- **Performance:** ✅ Pass - 18.04s < 30s target (39.9% faster)

## Handoff Notes

**For Integrator:**
- ✅ **W006 story COMPLETE** - All critical ACs pass (9/10, AC8 N/A)
- ✅ **Both subtasks validated:** W006-B01 (9 integration tests) and W006-B02 (4 policy tests) both shipped
- ✅ **Branch:** feat/W006-step-01-integration-tests (W006-B01 and W006-B02 already merged to main)
- ✅ **Deliverables:** 13 integration tests, test infrastructure, test fixtures
- ✅ **Quality:** Zero regressions, all quality gates pass, performance excellent
- ✅ **Known Items:**
  - 3 memory CRUD tests skip gracefully (update/delete tools not implemented - expected)
  - 9 warnings about qdrant-client deprecation (non-blocking, library issue)
  - 1 pytest marker warning (acceptance marker not registered - cosmetic)

**For Next Steps:**
- W006 story can be marked "done" (W006-B01 and W006-B02 already integrated)
- W007 (Configuration & Environment Setup) ready for planning
- W008 (Documentation Update) partially unblocked (W006 ✅, needs W007)

---

## Learnings

1. **Test Count Flexibility:** Planned 12 tests but implemented 13 - plan flexibility allows for additional coverage when beneficial
2. **Graceful Degradation Works:** Skip behavior for unimplemented tools is clean and well-documented
3. **W006 Story Structure:** Breaking into B01 (server+memory) and B02 (policy+regression) worked well for parallel execution and integration
4. **Test Performance Excellent:** 18.04s for 13 integration tests shows efficient test design and good fixture management
5. **Quality Gates Consistency:** All W006 subtasks passed quality gates consistently (black, ruff, build) - shows good execution discipline
