# Agent Completion Report: W006

**Task:** W006 - Basic Integration Testing  
**Agent:** Planner  
**Status:** needs_plan → planning complete  
**Started:** 2025-10-03T04:05:00+02:00  
**Completed:** 2025-10-03T04:10:00+02:00  
**Duration:** 5 minutes

## Objective

Plan and design comprehensive integration tests for the migrated MCP server to validate core functionality (server initialization, memory CRUD operations, policy system) and ensure zero regressions in existing code.

---

## Actions Taken

1. **Analyzed Current State:**
   - Reviewed existing test structure (tests/test_smoke.py - 2 tests for mdnotes module)
   - Identified empty tests/mcp/ directory requiring integration tests
   - Examined MCP server modules (mcp_server.py, memory_manager.py, policy_processor.py)
   - Confirmed pytest-asyncio already installed in dev dependencies

2. **Evaluated Alternatives:**
   - **Alternative 1:** Minimal smoke tests only (rejected - insufficient coverage)
   - **Alternative 2:** Comprehensive integration tests (CHOSEN - balanced scope)
   - **Alternative 3:** Full end-to-end test suite (rejected - over-scoped)

3. **Created AGENT_PLAN.md:**
   - Defined 6-step implementation plan
   - Broke down into 2 builder tasks (B01, B02) + 1 tester task (T01)
   - Specified 4 test files to create (conftest.py + 3 test modules)
   - Estimated ~2.5 hours total implementation time

4. **Created TEST_PLAN.md:**
   - Defined 10 acceptance criteria (5 functional + 5 non-functional)
   - Specified exact quality gate commands (black, ruff, mypy, pytest, build, pip-audit)
   - Detailed validation procedures for each AC
   - Set ≥85% coverage target on new test files

5. **Updated Sprint Artifacts:**
   - SPRINT_QUEUE.json: Added W006-B01 (ready), W006-B02 (blocked), W006-T01 (blocked)
   - SPRINT_PLAN.md: Documented W006 plan details and breakdown
   - AGENT_LOG.md: Recorded planner activity

---

---

## Metrics

- **Files Created:** 2 files (AGENT_PLAN.md, TEST_PLAN.md)
- **Files Updated:** 3 files (SPRINT_QUEUE.json, SPRINT_PLAN.md, AGENT_LOG.md)
- **Subtasks Created:** 3 subtasks (2 builder + 1 tester)
- **Implementation Steps:** 6 steps planned
- **Tests Planned:** 12 integration tests (4 server + 5 memory + 3 policy)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 ACs defined
- **Estimated Implementation Time:** ~2.5 hours (120 minutes)
- **Planning Time:** 5 minutes

---

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 1:** Balancing test coverage vs. scope
   - "Basic Integration Testing" could mean minimal smoke tests OR comprehensive integration tests
   - Need to provide sufficient coverage without over-engineering

2. **Challenge 2:** Qdrant dependency handling
   - MCP tests require Qdrant server running
   - Risk of test failures if Qdrant unavailable

3. **Challenge 3:** Test isolation and cleanup
   - Risk of test data pollution across tests
   - Need strategy for unique collection names and cleanup

---

## Solutions

1. **Solution to Challenge 1:**
   - Chose Alternative 2 (Comprehensive Integration Tests) for balanced coverage
   - Planned 12 tests covering critical functionality (server, memory, policy)
   - Organized into logical modules for maintainability
   - Estimated ~2.5 hours - reasonable for "basic" testing milestone

2. **Solution to Challenge 2:**
   - Specified pytest fixture `qdrant_available` to check Qdrant status
   - Plan to skip tests gracefully if Qdrant unavailable
   - Documented in handoff notes for Builder

3. **Solution to Challenge 3:**
   - Planned unique collection names per test using UUIDs
   - Specified cleanup fixtures in conftest.py
   - Added test isolation to AC9 (tests run independently)

---

## Quality Gates

Planning deliverables (not code, so N/A for most):

- **Black Formatting:** N/A (planning documents)
- **Ruff Linting:** N/A (planning documents)
- **Mypy Type Checking:** N/A (planning documents)
- **Plan Completeness:** ✅ Pass (all required sections present)
- **DoD Alignment:** ✅ Pass (10 ACs align with story requirements)
- **Traceability:** ✅ Pass (linked to OBJECTIVE.md → Quality & Performance → Integration Testing)
- **Implementability:** ✅ Pass (clear steps, reasonable estimates, achievable scope)

---

## Handoff Notes

**For Builder (W006-B01):**

**Key Points:**
- Create 4 test files in `tests/mcp/` directory
- Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Use `@pytest.mark.integration` marker for integration tests
- Start with conftest.py fixtures for test infrastructure

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Qdrant Dependency:** Add fixture to check Qdrant running, skip if unavailable
2. **Test Isolation:** Use unique collection names (e.g., f"test_collection_{uuid.uuid4()}")
3. **Cleanup:** Implement teardown fixtures to remove test collections
4. **Async Support:** All MCP operations are async, use pytest-asyncio

**Test Commands:**
- Run MCP tests only: `pytest tests/mcp/ -v`
- Run all tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
- Check coverage: `pytest --cov=tests/mcp --cov-report=term-missing`

**Expected Output:**
- 12 integration tests created (4 + 5 + 3)
- All tests pass on first run
- ≥85% coverage on new test files

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- Qdrant may not be running → tests should skip gracefully
- Async operations require proper event loop handling
- Test data cleanup is critical to avoid cross-test pollution

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Start with conftest.py (Step 1 - fixtures)
2. Then test_server_initialization.py (Step 2 - 4 tests)
3. Then test_memory_operations.py (Step 3 - 5 tests)

## Learnings

1. **Learning 1: Scope Calibration for "Basic" Testing**
   - "Basic Integration Testing" is ambiguous - could range from 1 smoke test to 50+ tests
   - Chose 12 tests as sweet spot: covers critical paths without over-engineering
   - Application: Future "basic" stories should specify test count range upfront

2. **Learning 2: Pytest Fixture Strategy for Integration Tests**
   - Shared fixtures in conftest.py enable DRY test code
   - Qdrant availability check prevents cryptic failures
   - Cleanup fixtures ensure test isolation
   - Application: Reuse this fixture pattern for future MCP test expansion

3. **Learning 3: Async Testing with MCP**
   - MCP server operations are async (await required)
   - pytest-asyncio already installed (from W003 dependency integration)
   - `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator required for async test functions
   - Application: All future MCP tests should follow this async pattern
