# Agent Completion Reports

This directory contains structured completion reports generated by agents after completing their work.

## Purpose

Agent completion reports provide:
- **Historical Context:** Understand what happened months later
- **Learning Loop:** Agents learn from past successes and failures
- **Debugging:** Trace back to see what each agent did when issues arise
- **Metrics:** Track agent efficiency, common patterns, and improvement over time
- **Handoff Clarity:** Next agent gets structured context, not just logs
- **Audit Trail:** Compliance, quality reviews, and process improvement

## Report Template

All reports use the template at `.oodatcaa/templates/AGENT_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` with these sections:

1. **Header:** Task, agent, status, timestamps, duration
2. **Objective:** What the task was meant to accomplish
3. **Actions Taken:** Numbered list of major actions
4. **Deliverables:** Concrete outputs produced
5. **Metrics:** Quantitative measurements (files changed, errors fixed, etc.)
6. **Challenges:** Problems encountered
7. **Solutions:** How challenges were addressed
8. **Quality Gates:** Results of all quality checks
9. **Handoff Notes:** Critical information for next agent
10. **Learnings:** Insights for future work
11. **References:** Links to plans, branches, PRs, commits
12. **Signature:** Agent info and completion timestamp

## Report Generation

### Required for All Agents

Every agent **MUST** generate a completion report before finishing work:

- **Planner:** `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/planner.md`
- **Builder:** `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/builder_<subtask>.md`
- **Tester:** `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/tester_<subtask>.md`
- **Refiner:** `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/refiner_<iteration>.md`
- **Integrator:** `.oodatcaa/work/reports/<TASK_ID>/integrator.md`

### Hybrid Approach

1. **Detailed Reports:** Per-task/per-subtask in this directory
2. **Executive Summary:** Consolidated index in `.oodatcaa/work/AGENT_REPORTS.md`

Each agent must:
1. Create detailed report using template
2. Append executive summary to `AGENT_REPORTS.md` with link

## Integration with Agent Protocols

Completion reports are **REQUIRED** in all agent prompts:

- **planner.md:** Step 9 - Create completion report
- **builder.md:** Step 8 - Create completion report
- **tester.md:** Step 6 - Create completion report
- **refiner.md:** Step 6 - Create completion report
- **integrator.md:** Step 7 - Create completion report

## Enforcement

The Negotiator verifies that completion reports exist before moving tasks to the next stage.

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Easy debugging when issues arise
- Clear understanding of what changed and why
- Historical context for maintenance

### For Agents
- Learn from past work (successes and failures)
- Structured handoff information
- Pattern recognition for common issues

### For Project Management
- Metrics on agent efficiency
- Sprint retrospectives
- Process improvement insights
- Audit trail for compliance

## Example: Reading a Report

To understand what happened in a task:

```bash
# View detailed report
cat .oodatcaa/work/reports/W004/builder_B01.md

# View executive summary
cat .oodatcaa/work/AGENT_REPORTS.md | grep -A 20 "W004-B01"

# List all reports for a task
ls -l .oodatcaa/work/reports/W004/
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- [ ] Automated metrics aggregation script
- [ ] Sprint retrospective generation from reports
- [ ] ML-based pattern recognition for common issues
- [ ] Agent efficiency trending dashboard
- [ ] Quality score tracking over time
