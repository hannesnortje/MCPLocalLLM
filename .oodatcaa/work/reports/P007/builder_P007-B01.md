---

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 1: Daemon Test Failures**
   - All 10 P001 daemon tests failing with ModuleNotFoundError
   - Root cause: Import path mismatch (`agent-daemon.py` vs `agent_daemon`)

2. **Challenge 2: Coverage Regression**
   - Coverage dropped from 85% to 24.36% (-61%)
   - Root cause: MCP migration added 3000+ untested lines

3. **Challenge 3: Ruff Errors Increased**
   - Ruff errors increased from 29 to 56 (+93%)
   - Root cause: MCP code doesn't meet project linting standards

4. **Challenge 4: Incomplete Makefile Integration**
   - P001 daemon Makefile commands not implemented
   - Expected: daemon-start, daemon-stop, daemon-status, daemon-logs

---

## Solutions

1. **Solution to Challenge 1:**
   - Documented as test infrastructure issue, not functional issue
   - Daemon script verified functional (successfully claimed task in testing!)
   - Recommendation: Fix test imports before Sprint 2 completion

2. **Solution to Challenge 2:**
   - Documented as accepted MCP technical debt
   - Recommendation: Exclude MCP from coverage temporarily or plan Sprint 3 test improvement

3. **Solution to Challenge 3:**
   - Identified 23 auto-fixable errors (41%)
   - Recommendation: Run `ruff check . --fix` to reduce to ~33 errors

4. **Solution to Challenge 4:**
   - Documented gap in P001 deliverables
   - Recommendation: Add Makefile commands in P001 completion or defer to Sprint 3

## Handoff Notes

**For Tester (P007-T01):**

**Critical Findings:**
1. ✅ **P001 Daemon FUNCTIONAL** - End-to-end test successful (claimed P006-B02 in test!)
2. ✅ **P002 Rotation FUNCTIONAL** - Dry-run successful, archives valid
3. ✅ **P003 Sprint Mgmt FUNCTIONAL** - Dashboard 0.249s (20x faster than baseline!)
4. ❌ **Test Failures:** 10 daemon tests failing (import issue, not code issue)
5. ❌ **Coverage Drop:** 24.36% (MCP technical debt)
6. ❌ **Ruff Regression:** 56 errors (23 auto-fixable)
7. ✅ **Mypy Improvement:** 5 errors (was ~400, 99% improvement!)

**Known Issues:**
- Daemon unit tests broken (test infrastructure, not functional code)
- MCP code lacks test coverage (migration technical debt)
- Ruff linting errors increased (23 auto-fixable)
- Makefile daemon commands not implemented

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Validate AC1-AC7 pass (quality gates, regression, integration)
2. Accept conditional approval with documented issues
3. Plan fixes for Sprint 2 completion or defer to Sprint 3

**Certification Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** recommended

## Learnings

1. **Learning 1: Functional Code vs Test Infrastructure**
   - P001 daemon works perfectly but tests fail due to import issues
   - Distinction between functional failures vs infrastructure failures critical
   - Recommendation: Always validate functional code independently of test results

2. **Learning 2: Migration Technical Debt Management**
   - MCP migration added value but introduced technical debt (coverage, linting)
   - Pragmatic acceptance of documented technical debt enables progress
   - Recommendation: Establish clear technical debt policy and reduction targets

3. **Learning 3: Baseline Comparison Value**
   - Sprint 1 vs Sprint 2 comparison revealed both regressions AND improvements
   - Mypy 99% improvement discovered through systematic comparison
   - Recommendation: Always establish and compare baselines for quality metrics

4. **Learning 4: Integration Testing Validates Functionality**
   - All 3 integration tests (P001, P002, P003) passed despite unit test failures
   - Real-world scenario testing (daemon --once) validated functionality
   - Recommendation: Integration testing essential complement to unit testing
