**Agent:** Builder (agent-builder-cursor)  
**Status:** in_progress → awaiting_test  
**Started:** 2025-10-04T16:35:31+02:00  
**Completed:** 2025-10-04T17:10:00+02:00

## Objective

Create comprehensive operational documentation for the OODATCAA system including operational runbook (20+ scenarios), troubleshooting guide (30+ issues), and onboarding guide (15-minute quick start).

---

## Deliverables

### 1. RUNBOOK.md (1,472 lines)
**20 operational scenarios covering:**
- Sprint Operations (4 scenarios): Starting sprints, completing sprints, checking status, viewing agent activity
- Agent Operations (6 scenarios): Starting/stopping agents, manual execution, task claiming, WIP limits, lease management
- System Maintenance (5 scenarios): Health checks, configuration validation, prompt updates, log management, archiving
- Emergency Procedures (5 scenarios): System recovery, rollbacks, stuck tasks, debugging, emergency stop

**Key features:**
- Step-by-step procedures with commands
- Expected output examples
- Troubleshooting per scenario
- Cross-references to related docs
- Quick reference card

### 2. TROUBLESHOOTING.md (1,833 lines)
**30 issues with detailed resolutions:**
- Agent Issues (10): Won't claim work, crashes, invalid output, ignores instructions, stale leases, race conditions, outdated protocols, integration failures, false test failures, infeasible plans
- System Issues (9): JSON corruption, git conflicts, disk space, high CPU, permissions, dependencies, performance, network failures, systemd issues
- Process Issues (11): Sprint initialization, completion, dependency deadlock, adaptation loops, merge conflicts, work duplication, log management, incomplete reports, coverage, documentation sync, stale branches

**Each issue includes:**
- Symptoms (what you observe)
- Diagnosis (investigation steps)
- Solution (resolution procedure)
- Prevention (avoid recurrence)

### 3. ONBOARDING.md (1,012 lines)
**Complete onboarding path:**
- Quick Start (15 minutes): Clone→Setup→Validate→Status→Test
- Core Concepts (20 minutes): OODATCAA loop, 11 agent roles, key files, task lifecycle, lease system, WIP limits, quality gates
- First Sprint Walkthrough (30 minutes): Review objective, check status, run builder/tester/integrator
- Common Tasks (reference): Status checks, agent management, sprint operations, troubleshooting
- Development Workflows: Feature development, bug fixes, documentation updates, refactoring
- Best Practices: For operators and developers
- Next Steps: Learning paths, recommended reading
- Quick Reference Card: Essential commands and directories

## Handoff Notes

**For Tester (P006-T01):**

**Validation Areas:**
1. **Documentation Accuracy:**
   - Verify commands work as documented
   - Check file paths are correct
   - Validate JSON examples parse correctly
   - Test example scenarios

2. **Content Completeness:**
   - RUNBOOK: 20+ scenarios (AC1)
   - TROUBLESHOOTING: 30+ issues (AC2)
   - ONBOARDING: 15-minute quick start (AC3)
   - All cross-references valid

3. **Link Validation:**
   - All internal links resolve
   - Cross-references between docs work
   - No broken markdown links

4. **Usability:**
   - Quick start achievable in 15 minutes
   - Procedures clear and actionable
   - Examples realistic and helpful

**Known Considerations:**
- Documentation based on Sprint 2 state (P001-P005 complete)
- Some commands require dev dependencies
- Systemd examples Linux-specific (CLI alternatives provided)
