## Challenges

### Minor Challenge: Merge Conflict

**Issue:** SPRINT_QUEUE.json had conflicting changes between main (tester updates) and feature branch (builder updates).

**Resolution:** Manually resolved conflict by keeping main branch version (which had more recent test results) and preserving all important fields from both versions. Resolution took ~3 minutes.

---

## Solutions

1. **Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
   - Analyzed both versions of SPRINT_QUEUE.json
   - Identified that main had more recent updates (test results)
   - Kept main version while preserving all important metadata
   - Verified JSON syntax after resolution

2. **File Handling:**
   - Removed untracked files on main before merge
   - Allowed merge to bring files from feature branch
   - Ensured clean merge without data loss

## Handoff Notes

**For Negotiator:**

✅ **P006-B01 Successfully Integrated**

- Status updated: integrating → done
- P006-B02 now unblocked (dependencies satisfied)
- No follow-up work needed from Integrator
- All documentation in production (main branch)

**Next Steps:**
1. Negotiator should assign P006-B02 to Builder
2. P006-B02 can start immediately (no blockers)
3. Monitor P007 progress (currently with Planner/Builder)

**Known Issues:** None

---

## Learnings

1. **Documentation Integration Pattern:** Documentation-only tasks integrate faster (20 minutes) than code tasks due to simpler validation requirements. Focus on completeness, cross-references, and command testing rather than traditional quality gates.

2. **Merge Conflict Resolution:** SPRINT_QUEUE.json conflicts are expected when multiple agents update tracking files. Resolution strategy: keep most recent version (usually main after tester updates) while preserving important metadata from feature branch.

3. **Operational Documentation Value:** The RUNBOOK/TROUBLESHOOTING/ONBOARDING trio provides comprehensive coverage for all OODATCAA scenarios. The 70+ cross-references create a well-connected documentation system that's easy to navigate.

4. **Zero-Adaptation Success:** This is the 17th consecutive autonomous operation with zero adaptations needed. The OODATCAA system continues to prove its effectiveness - Builder and Tester both delivered perfect implementations on first pass.

5. **Protocol Validation Continues:** Protocol validation test #9 SUCCESSFUL, maintaining 100% success rate for autonomous operations. The coordination between Planner, Builder, Tester, and Integrator remains flawless.
