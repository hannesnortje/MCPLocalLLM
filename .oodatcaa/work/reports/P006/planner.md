# Planner Completion Report: P006

**Report ID:** P006-PLANNER-001  
**Task:** P006 - Process Documentation & Runbook  
**Agent:** agent-planner-A  
**Role:** Planner  
**Date:** 2025-10-03T22:35:00+02:00  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Planning Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully planned P006 (Process Documentation & Runbook), a Medium-complexity documentation task to create comprehensive operational documentation for the OODATCAA system. The plan consolidates existing documentation and adds 4 new major docs (RUNBOOK, TROUBLESHOOTING, ONBOARDING, ARCHITECTURE) plus enhancement of 10 agent protocols. Implementation breaks down into 3 builder tasks (~7.5 hours) with P006-B01 blocked by dependencies (P001, P003, P004) but ready once prerequisites complete. Designed with practical operational focus, integrating all Sprint 2 infrastructure into actionable procedures.

**Key Achievement:** Comprehensive documentation strategy covering 20+ operational scenarios, 30+ troubleshooting issues, 15-minute onboarding path, 5 Mermaid architecture diagrams, and enhanced agent protocols, all cross-linked and integrated.

## Objective

**Sprint 2 Goal:** OODATCAA Process Improvement - Automate and enhance multi-agent development

**P006 Objective Link:** Process Documentation Complete

**Success Criteria Addressed:**
1. Runbook: Practical guide with common scenarios, commands, troubleshooting
2. Agent Protocols: Enhanced prompts with examples and edge cases
3. Onboarding Guide: New user/agent guide with quick start and architecture

**Problem Solved:** Sprint 2 delivered significant infrastructure (P001-P004) but documentation is fragmented across 14+ files with no operational runbook, troubleshooting guide, or structured onboarding path. P006 consolidates and enhances documentation for operational effectiveness.

---

## Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (5 minutes)

**Activities:**
1. Reviewed Sprint 2 Objective for documentation requirements
2. Surveyed existing documentation (14 files in `.oodatcaa/`)
3. Analyzed P001-P004 systems needing documentation
4. Identified gaps: runbook, troubleshooting, onboarding, enhanced prompts

**Key Findings:**
- 14 existing docs but fragmented
- No operational runbook or troubleshooting guide
- Agent prompts functional but lack examples
- P001-P004 systems need operational procedures
- Onboarding requires reading multiple disconnected docs

### Phase 2: Alternative Analysis (10 minutes)

**Three Alternatives Evaluated:**

**Alternative 1: Minimal Documentation Updates** ❌ Rejected
- Only update prompts, add troubleshooting to README
- Insufficient for operational needs

**Alternative 2: Comprehensive Documentation Portal** ❌ Rejected
- HTML site with Sphinx/MkDocs
- Over-engineering for internal tool

**Alternative 3: Structured Markdown Documentation** ✅ CHOSEN
- Focused markdown files with cross-linking
- Agent-readable, version controlled, low maintenance

**Decision:** Structured markdown optimal for agent-driven development.

### Phase 3: Implementation Design (10 minutes)

**7-Step Plan:**

1. **Operational Runbook (90 min):** 20+ scenarios (Sprint/Agent/System Ops)
2. **Troubleshooting Guide (75 min):** 30+ issues (Agent/System/Process)
3. **Onboarding Guide (60 min):** 15-minute quick start path
4. **Enhanced Agent Protocols (90 min):** 10 prompts with examples/edge cases
5. **Architecture Documentation (60 min):** 5 Mermaid diagrams + integration points
6. **Navigation & Integration (45 min):** Cross-linking and consolidation
7. **Quality & Polish (30 min):** Link validation, spell check, consistency

**Task Grouping:**
- P006-B01 (Large): Steps 1-3 (225 min) - Runbook + Troubleshooting + Onboarding
- P006-B02 (Medium): Steps 4-5 (150 min) - Protocols + Architecture
- P006-B03 (Small): Steps 6-7 (75 min) - Navigation + Quality
- P006-T01 (Medium): Testing (45 min) - All 10 ACs

### Phase 4: Test Plan Creation (5 minutes)

**10 Acceptance Criteria:**
1. RUNBOOK.md complete with 20+ scenarios
2. TROUBLESHOOTING.md with 30+ issues
3. ONBOARDING.md with 15-minute quick start
4. All 10 agent prompts enhanced
5. ARCHITECTURE.md with 5 diagrams
6. Navigation improved across all docs
7. All docs cross-linked
8. Quality checks pass
9. Existing docs consolidated
10. P001-P004 systems documented
