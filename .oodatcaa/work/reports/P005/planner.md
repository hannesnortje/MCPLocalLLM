3. Agent Communication: Protocol improvements (structured format, decision transparency, conflict resolution)

---

## Planning Activities

### 1. Repository Analysis (Observe & Orient)

**Agent Prompt Inventory:**
- Identified 11 current agent roles in `.oodatcaa/prompts/`
- **Core Development:** negotiator, sprint-planner, planner, builder, tester, refiner, integrator, project-completion-detector
- **Utilities:** sprint-close, release, triage
- Each prompt reviewed for responsibilities, inputs/outputs, decision authority

**Sprint 1/2 Evidence Collection:**
- Sprint 1: 34 tasks completed, 91.9% success rate, 4 adaptation cycles (W004, W005, W006-B01, W007-B01, W008-B01)
- Sprint 2: 4 tasks complete (P002-B01 perfect, P004 OODATCAA documentation, P003/P006 planning)
- Agent reports analyzed from `.oodatcaa/work/reports/`
- Workflow patterns extracted from `SPRINT_LOG.md`

**Current System Assessment:**
- 11 functional agents with proven track record
- File-based coordination (SPRINT_QUEUE.json, leases, locks)
- Informal communication patterns (effective but not documented)
- No formal conflict resolution protocol
- Decision authority implicit in prompts

---

### 2. Alternatives Analysis (Decide)

**Three alternatives evaluated:**

#### Alternative 1: Survey-Based Agent Assessment ❌
- **Approach:** Quantitative scoring of agent capabilities
- **Pros:** Repeatable, objective, statistical analysis
- **Cons:** Overkill for 11 agents, requires metrics framework, doesn't capture nuanced interactions
- **Verdict:** Rejected - too formal for internal process improvement

#### Alternative 2: Agent Performance Benchmarking ❌
- **Approach:** Performance metrics (execution times, success rates)
- **Pros:** Data-driven, optimization focus, clear metrics
- **Cons:** Requires extensive infrastructure, focuses on performance not completeness, doesn't address role gaps
- **Verdict:** Rejected - different goal than P005 (performance vs completeness)

#### Alternative 3: Qualitative Analysis with Evidence ✅ **CHOSEN**
- **Approach:** Systematic review of prompts, Sprint 1/2 reports, workflow analysis, evidence-based recommendations
- **Pros:** Appropriate scale, uses real sprint data, identifies structural and operational gaps, actionable recommendations, no new infrastructure
- **Cons:** Some subjective elements, depends on documentation quality
- **Verdict:** Chosen - right balance of rigor and practicality

**Decision Rationale:** Alternative 3 uses proven Sprint 1/2 evidence to identify real gaps from actual multi-agent execution, making recommendations practical and grounded rather than theoretical.

---

### 3. Implementation Plan Design

**Breakdown Strategy:** 7 steps → 3 builder tasks + 1 tester task

#### Step 1-3: Agent Audit + Interaction Analysis + Evidence (P005-B01)
**Estimated:** 225 minutes (~3.75 hours)

**Step 1: Current Agent Audit (90 min)**
- Create `.oodatcaa/AGENT_ROLES_MATRIX.md`
- Document all 11 agents: role, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, decision authority, success criteria, Sprint 1/2 usage
- Extract I/O contracts from prompts
- Analyze SPRINT_QUEUE.json interaction patterns

**Step 2: Agent Interaction Analysis (75 min)**
- Map workflow patterns (primary development flow, adaptation loop, sprint lifecycle, project completion)
- Analyze Sprint 1/2 interactions from reports
- Document communication patterns (file-based messages, lease/lock protocols, log entries)
- Identify decision points (Negotiator task assignment, Planner alternative selection, Tester accept/reject, etc.)
- Create `.oodatcaa/AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md`

**Step 3: Sprint 1/2 Evidence Analysis (60 min)**
- Sprint 1: 34 tasks, 91.9% success, 4 adaptations → lessons learned
- Sprint 2: Current progress, P002-B01 perfect implementation, P004 complete
- Adaptation pattern analysis (why adaptations occurred, how resolved)
- Performance metrics (task times, adaptation success rate, handoff efficiency)
- Document evidence in `AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

**Deliverables:** AGENT_ROLES_MATRIX.md, AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md (partial), Evidence analysis

---

#### Step 4-5: Gap Analysis + Communication Protocol (P005-B02)
**Estimated:** 135 minutes (~2.25 hours)  
**Dependencies:** P005-B01 complete

**Step 4: Gap Analysis (75 min)**
- Workflow coverage analysis (development well-covered, monitoring/review/architecture gaps)
- Evaluate suggested agents:
  - **Monitor Agent:** Continuous sprint watching (Medium priority, defer until P001 daemon complete)
  - **Architect Agent:** Design decisions (Low priority, Planner sufficient for now)
  - **Reviewer Agent:** Code review beyond quality gates (Medium priority, consider Sprint 3+)
  - **Releaser/Deployer:** Full deployment automation (Low priority, not production-ready yet)
- Communication gap analysis (no structured message format, informal decision logging, inconsistent status reporting)
- Complete gap analysis section in `AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

**Step 5: Communication Protocol Design (60 min)**
- Design structured message format (JSON example with from_agent, to_agent, task_id, message_type, content, decision_required)
- Define decision transparency requirements (decision, rationale, alternatives, evidence, confidence)
- Standardize status reporting (required fields: timestamp, agent, task, action, outcome, metrics)
- Formalize conflict resolution protocol (disagreement → SPRINT_DISCUSS.md → Negotiator decision → log)
- Document in AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md

**Deliverables:** AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md (complete), Communication protocol in AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md

---

#### Step 6-7: Recommendations + Integration (P005-B03)
**Estimated:** 75 minutes (~1.25 hours)  
**Dependencies:** P005-B02 complete

**Step 6: Recommendations & Prioritization (45 min)**
- Prioritize gaps:
  - **High Priority:** Communication protocol standardization, decision transparency
  - **Medium Priority:** Monitor agent (after P001), Reviewer agent (complex features)
  - **Low Priority:** Architect agent (Planner sufficient), Enhanced Releaser (not needed yet)
- Create implementation roadmap:
  - Sprint 2: Document agents, standardize communication (P005 deliverable)
  - Sprint 3: Monitor agent (if P001 enables), Negotiator conflict resolution
  - Sprint 4+: Reviewer agent, Release enhancement
- Feasibility assessment (effort, dependencies, risk, benefit)
- Complete recommendations in `AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

**Step 7: Documentation Integration (30 min)**
- Cross-link with existing docs (OODATCAA_LOOP_GUIDE, ARCHITECTURE, README, prompts)
- Update agent prompts with I/O contract clarifications (no protocol changes)
- Create navigation ("See Also" sections, bidirectional links)
- Final quality check (valid links, consistent terminology, date stamps)

**Deliverables:** Complete recommendations, documentation integration, cross-links

---

#### Testing: Verify All 10 ACs (P005-T01)
**Estimated:** 45 minutes  
**Dependencies:** P005-B03 complete

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Analysis Paralysis
**Description:** Over-analyzing without actionable outcomes  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (wasted effort)  
**Mitigation:** Focus on practical gaps with Sprint 1/2 evidence, concrete recommendations only

### Risk 2: Agent Proliferation
**Description:** Proposing too many new agents  
**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** High (complexity explosion)  
**Mitigation:** Only propose agents that fill clear gaps, defer low-priority agents, respect 91.9% Sprint 1 success rate

### Risk 3: Disrupting Working System
**Description:** Recommendations that break successful patterns  
**Probability:** Low  
**Impact:** High (regression)  
**Mitigation:** Document current state first, changes are recommendations not requirements, Sprint 1 success demonstrates system works

### Risk 4: Subjective Assessment
**Description:** Bias in identifying gaps  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (false positives/negatives)  
**Mitigation:** Use evidence from Sprint 1/2 reports, cite specific task IDs and metrics, validate gaps with real execution data

---

## Dependencies

**Blocked By:**
- None (P005-B01 ready to start immediately)

---

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Qualitative Analysis Approach
**Choice:** Evidence-based qualitative analysis over survey or benchmarking  
**Rationale:** Right scale for 11-agent system, uses proven Sprint 1/2 data, actionable recommendations without new infrastructure  
**Alternatives Rejected:** Survey-based (too formal), Benchmarking (wrong goal)  
**Confidence:** High

### Decision 2: Gap Analysis Scope
**Choice:** Focus on Monitor, Reviewer, Communication protocol as practical gaps  
**Rationale:** Sprint 1/2 evidence shows these would address real workflow needs (continuous monitoring for daemon, review beyond quality gates, formal communication)  
**Alternatives Rejected:** Architect (Planner sufficient), Deployer (premature)  
**Confidence:** High

### Decision 3: Priority Ranking
**Choice:** High = Communication protocol, Medium = Monitor/Reviewer, Low = Architect/Deployer  
**Rationale:** Communication improvements benefit all agents immediately, Monitor depends on P001 daemon, Reviewer valuable for complex features, Architect/Deployer not needed yet  
**Evidence:** Sprint 1 informal communication worked (91.9% success) but standardization will scale better  
**Confidence:** Medium (subject to Sprint 1/2 continued analysis)

### Decision 4: Sprint 1/2 Evidence Requirement
**Choice:** All assessments must cite specific Sprint 1/2 data (task IDs, metrics, reports)  
**Rationale:** Prevents theoretical recommendations, ensures practical value, respects current system success  
**Example:** "Monitor agent needed" must show where manual Negotiator runs caused delays  
**Confidence:** High

---

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Balancing Rigor and Practicality
**Issue:** How formal should the assessment be for an 11-agent internal system?  
**Solution:** Chose qualitative approach with Sprint 1/2 evidence over survey/benchmarking. Provides rigor through data citations while staying practical.  
**Outcome:** 10 ACs ensure thoroughness without over-engineering.

### Challenge 2: Defining "Gap"
**Issue:** Is a gap a missing agent type, or insufficient capabilities in existing agents?  
**Solution:** Both. Gap analysis covers missing agents (Monitor, Reviewer) AND missing capabilities (communication protocol, conflict resolution).  
**Outcome:** Broader scope increases value of P005.

### Challenge 3: Avoiding Disruption
**Issue:** Sprint 1 achieved 91.9% success. How to improve without breaking what works?  
**Solution:** Focus on documentation and recommendations, not immediate changes. Make all changes optional and evidence-based.  
**Outcome:** P005 produces analysis, future tasks implement changes if validated.
