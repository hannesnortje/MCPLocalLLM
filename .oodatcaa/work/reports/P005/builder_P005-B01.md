**Complete agent capability matrix including:**

**11 Agents Documented:**
1. Negotiator (Coordinator) - Continuous coordination loop
2. Sprint Planner - Autonomous sprint goal generation
3. Planner - Detailed task planning (Observe+Orient+Decide)
4. Builder - Implementation (Act)
5. Tester - Validation (Test+Check)
6. Refiner - Adaptation (Adapt)
7. Integrator - Integration (Archive)
8. Project Completion Detector - Autonomous done detection
9. Sprint Close - Sprint finalization
10. Releaser - Release finalization (RC → GA)
11. Triage - Fast bug → work item conversion

**7 Attributes Per Agent:**
- Role & OODATCAA stage
- Responsibilities (detailed bullet points)
- Inputs (all consumed files)
- Outputs (all produced files)
- Decision Authority (High/Medium/Low with specific decisions)
- Success Criteria (measurable outcomes)

**Quality:**
- ✅ All 11 agents complete with 7 attributes each
- ✅ Accurate descriptions (verified against `.oodatcaa/prompts/*.md`)
- ✅ Sprint 1/2 evidence cited (W001-W008, P001-P006)
- ✅ Cross-references to all agent prompts

---

### 2. AGENT_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md (1828 lines)

**Comprehensive interaction guide including:**

**Communication Mechanisms:**
1. **File-Based Messaging:**
   - SPRINT_QUEUE.json (central task coordination)
   - AGENT_LOG.md (chronological activity log)
   - SPRINT_LOG.md (sprint-level events)
   - AGENT_PLAN.md (implementation plans)
   - TEST_PLAN.md (quality gates & ACs)
   - SPRINT_PLAN.md (agent assignments)
   - Atomic update patterns documented

2. **Lease Protocol:**
   - Lease file structure (JSON schema)
   - TTLs by agent type (Builder: 90min, Tester: 45min, Planner: 30min)
   - Lifecycle (acquisition, heartbeat, release)
   - Stale lease detection by Negotiator
   - Code examples for each stage

3. **Lock Protocol:**
   - Lock file structure
   - 5-minute TTL for all locks
   - Breakable locks with log note
   - Lockable files (AGENT_PLAN.md, TEST_PLAN.md, AGENT_LOG.md)

4. **Status Transitions:**
   - State machine diagram (text format)
   - 11 status definitions with ownership
   - Transition rules (only assigned agent, logging required, lease management)

**4 Workflow Patterns:**
1. **Primary Development Flow:** Sprint Planner → Planner → Builder → Tester → Integrator
2. **Adaptation Loop:** Tester → Refiner → Builder → Tester
3. **Sprint Lifecycle Management:** Sprint Planner → Negotiator → Development Agents → Sprint Close
4. **Project Completion Detection:** Sprint Planner → Project Completion Detector → Sprint Planner

**Handoff Procedures:**
- Builder → Tester (5-step checklist)
- Tester → Integrator (happy path, 4 steps)
- Tester → Refiner (failure path, 4 steps)
- Integrator → Done (6 steps with unblocking effect)

**Real-World Examples:**
- **P002-B01:** Perfect implementation (100% first-attempt success, 135 minutes)
- **W004:** Adaptation loop (performance issue, quick fix, 100 minutes total)
- **P003 Parallel Execution:** Multiple builders working simultaneously (30 min savings)

**Failure Patterns & Recovery:**
- Stale lease recovery (detection + cleanup)
- JSON corruption recovery (backup + validation)
- Deadlock detection (circular dependencies)
- Start-Over gate (fundamental failure rollback protocol)

**10 Best Practices:**
1. Atomic file operations
2. Heartbeat discipline
3. Always release leases
4. Log before status change
5. Validate JSON after write
6. Create completion reports
7. Use descriptive commit messages
8. Cross-reference aggressively
9. Status transitions must be logged
10. Prefer quick fixes over rollbacks

**Quality:**
- ✅ 4+ workflow patterns documented
- ✅ Communication mechanisms complete (file-based, leases, locks, status)
- ✅ 3+ real-world examples from Sprint 1/2
- ✅ Handoff procedures with checklists
- ✅ Failure recovery patterns

**Solution:**
- Structured approach: Agent audit → Interaction analysis → Evidence analysis
- Templates for consistency (agent section format, workflow pattern format)
- Parallel reading of prompts + reports for efficiency

**Outcome:** 3,540 lines of comprehensive documentation in 135 minutes (40% under estimate)

---

### Challenge 2: Evidence Accuracy

### Challenge 3: Workflow Pattern Clarity

**Issue:** Workflow patterns needed to be clear, actionable, and illustrated with real examples

**Solution:**
- Text-based diagrams (ASCII flow charts)
- Step-by-step communication flows
- Real-world examples with timeline (P002-B01: 135 min, W004 adaptation: 100 min)
- Handoff checklists (actionable items)

**Outcome:** 4 workflow patterns documented with 3+ real-world examples, clear handoff procedures
