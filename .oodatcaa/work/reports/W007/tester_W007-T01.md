  - README.md ❌ (NOT modified - AC8 failure)

**Verdict:** Repository clean, only intended files

---

## Challenges

1. **AC8 Complete Failure:** README.md was not updated with setup documentation
   - W007-B01 scope included steps 1-6 (configuration files + setup scripts)
   - W007-B02 scope includes step 7 (documentation)
   - Builder notes indicate W007-B01 completed, but AC8 is a **critical requirement**

2. **AC7 Ruff Baseline Exceeded:** 32 errors vs 28 baseline
   - 3 new errors introduced in scripts/validate-env.py
   - F401 unused imports (os, typing.Any)
   - F541 unnecessary f-string formatting

3. **Docker Compose Validation Unavailable:** Cannot test `docker-compose config` command
   - docker-compose not installed on test system
   - Manual review conducted instead
   - AC2 marked as partial pass

4. **Mypy Full Count Unknown:** Only 5 errors shown before errors prevented further checking
   - Cannot compare against baseline ≤401
   - May require dependency stubs installation

---

## Solutions

### Solution to Challenge 1 (AC8 Failure - CRITICAL)
**Recommendation:** Mark W007-B01 as **needs_adapt**
- **Option A (Quick Fix - 30-45 min):** Builder updates README.md with setup section
  - Add "Setup & Installation" section with 5-step instructions
  - Add prerequisites (Python 3.11+, Docker optional)
  - Add configuration explanation (.env, config.yaml)
  - Add troubleshooting section (3-5 common issues)
- **Option B (Defer to W007-B02):** Accept current state, move documentation to W007-B02
  - W007-B02 already scoped for "Documentation + Quality Gates" (step 7-8)
  - Would require re-testing W007-B02 to validate AC8
  - Maintains separation of concerns

**Recommended:** **Option A** - Documentation is critical for developer onboarding

---

### Solution to Challenge 2 (AC7 Ruff Failure)
**Recommendation:** Quick fix in scripts/validate-env.py (5 min)
- Remove unused imports: `os` (line 7), `typing.Any` (line 10)
- Fix f-string: Change `f"\n❌ Environment validation FAILED!"` to `"\n❌ Environment validation FAILED!"` (line 221)
- Re-run ruff: Should reduce to 29 errors (1 over baseline, acceptable for negotiation)

**Alternative:** Apply `--fix` for 3 auto-fixable errors
- Run `ruff check . --fix` to auto-fix F401 and F541 errors
- Verify 29 errors remain (within negotiation range)

---

### Solution to Challenge 3 (Docker Compose Validation)
**Recommendation:** Manual review sufficient
- AC2 test plan includes manual review steps
- All manual checks passed
- docker-compose.yml syntax appears valid
- Mark AC2 as PASS with note about unavailable automated test

---

### Solution to Challenge 4 (Mypy Full Count)
**Recommendation:** Run full mypy with error suppression to get count
- Run `mypy . 2>&1 | grep "error:" | wc -l` to get total count
- Compare against baseline ≤401
- If within baseline, mark as PASS
- If over baseline, add to needs_adapt list

## Handoff Notes

### For Refiner (if needs_adapt):
**Critical Issues:**
1. ❌ **AC8 FAILURE:** README.md missing "Setup & Installation" section
   - Add 5-step setup instructions
   - Add prerequisites section (Python 3.11+, Docker optional)
   - Add configuration section (.env, config.yaml)
   - Add troubleshooting section (3-5 common issues)
   - Estimated time: 30-45 minutes

2. ❌ **AC7 RUFF FAILURE:** 32 errors (4 over baseline of 28)
   - Fix 3 errors in scripts/validate-env.py:
     - Remove `import os` (line 7)
     - Remove `from typing import Any` (line 10)
     - Fix f-string on line 221 (remove f prefix)
   - Re-run ruff to verify ≤29 errors
   - Estimated time: 5 minutes

**Total Estimated Adaptation Time:** 35-50 minutes

**Known Issues to Watch:**
- Mypy full count unknown (need full scan)
- pip 25.2 vulnerability severity unknown
- docker-compose.yml not tested with actual Docker Compose command

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix AC8 (README documentation) - CRITICAL
2. Fix AC7 (Ruff errors in validate-env.py) - 5 min
3. Get full mypy error count for comparison
4. Re-test all 10 ACs
5. If all pass → mark ready_for_integrator

---

### For Integrator (if approved):
**DO NOT INTEGRATE** - W007-B01 has 2 critical failures (AC7, AC8)

**When Ready for Integration:**
- W007-B01 branch: `feat/W007-step-01-config-setup`
- Files to include:
  - .env.example
  - config.example.yaml (modified)
  - docker-compose.yml (modified)
  - scripts/setup-dev.sh
  - scripts/validate-env.py
  - Makefile (modified)
  - README.md (modified) ← **MUST BE UPDATED**
- Commits: 3d25cfd, 5e84a29 (+ adaptation commits)
- Tag: `W007-B01-complete` (after adaptation)

---

## Learnings

1. **Critical AC Tracking:** AC8 marked as CRITICAL but was not in W007-B01 scope
   - W007-B01: Steps 1-6 (configuration files + setup scripts)
   - W007-B02: Steps 7-8 (documentation + quality gates)
   - Planner split documentation from implementation
   - Tester must validate CRITICAL ACs regardless of task scope split

2. **Quality Gate Baselines:** New code must not exceed established baselines
   - W005 established: Ruff ≤28 errors, Mypy ≤401 errors
   - W007-B01 introduced 4 new ruff errors (3 fixable, 1 formatting)
   - Prevention: Run quality gates before commit, not after

3. **Setup Script Testing:** Environment validation scripts are self-documenting
   - scripts/validate-env.py clearly shows all prerequisites
   - Developers can see exactly what's required before setup
   - Error messages guide users to resolution

4. **Documentation Before Code:** README updates should accompany implementation
   - Prevents disconnect between code completion and documentation
   - Ensures developers can immediately use new features
   - Critical for onboarding and setup tasks

5. **Test Environment Constraints:** Not all test commands available on all systems
   - docker-compose not installed on test system
   - Manual review can substitute for automated tests
   - Document test environment requirements in TEST_PLAN.md

Quality Gates:
- Black:     ✅ PASS
- Ruff:      ❌ FAIL (32 errors, baseline ≤28, **4 over**)
- Mypy:      ⚠️ PARTIAL (5 errors shown, full count needed)
- Pytest:    ✅ PASS (13/16 passed, 3 skipped)
- Build:     ✅ PASS
- Security:  ⚠️ WARNING (pip 25.2 vulnerability, severity TBD)

Overall Result: ❌ FAIL (6/10 ACs pass, 2 CRITICAL failures)

Notes:
- AC8 (README documentation) is CRITICAL and completely missing
- AC7 (Ruff) exceeded baseline by 4 errors (3 trivial fixes in validate-env.py)
- AC6 (tests) maintained W006 baseline perfectly (zero regressions)
- AC2 (docker-compose) manual review passed (automated test unavailable)
- All configuration files (AC1, AC3) meet or exceed requirements
- Setup scripts (AC4, AC5) comprehensive and functional

Recommendation: **needs_adapt**

Rationale:
1. AC8 failure is CRITICAL - developers cannot set up project without documentation
2. AC7 failure is minor but exceeds baseline - 5 minute fix required
3. 6/10 ACs pass, but 2 failures include 1 CRITICAL AC
4. Estimated adaptation time: 35-50 minutes
5. NOT ready for integration without fixes
```
