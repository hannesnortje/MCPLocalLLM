## Actions Taken

1. **Acquired planning lease** for W007 (TTL: 30 minutes)
2. **Analyzed current configuration state:**
   - Reviewed existing `config.py` (environment variable loading)
   - Reviewed existing `server_config.py` (YAML configuration management)
   - Reviewed existing `docker-compose.yml` (container orchestration)
   - Reviewed existing `config.example.yaml` (example configuration)
   - Identified gaps: no .env.example, no setup script, no validation tool
3. **Loaded project rules and doctrine** (@Cursor Rules, @Project Rules, doctrine.md)
4. **Reviewed OBJECTIVE.md and SPRINT_GOAL.md** for alignment
5. **Read SPRINT_BACKLOG.md** for W007 requirements
6. **Created AGENT_PLAN.md** with 9-step implementation plan:

   - 10 explicit acceptance criteria
   - Task breakdown (W007-B01, W007-B02, W007-T01)
   - Risk assessment and mitigations
7. **Created TEST_PLAN.md** with comprehensive test procedures:
   - Test commands for all quality gates
   - Detailed test steps for all 10 ACs
   - Test execution summary template
   - Rollback triggers and success criteria
8. **Updated SPRINT_QUEUE.json:**
   - W007 status: planning → ready

## Challenges

**Challenge 1: Balancing Scope**
- **Description:** W007 could range from minimal (just .env.example) to comprehensive (full config framework)
- **Impact:** Risk of under-delivering or over-engineering

**Challenge 2: Training-Specific Configuration**
- **Description:** Determining appropriate defaults for local M1 Max training vs production
- **Impact:** Configuration might not suit all developers

**Challenge 3: Docker Optionality**
- **Description:** Docker required for local Qdrant but might not be available on all systems
- **Impact:** Setup might fail without clear fallback

---

## Solutions

**Solution to Challenge 1:**
- Evaluated 3 alternatives (minimal, comprehensive, pragmatic)
- Selected pragmatic approach: functional + maintainable
- Delivers complete setup experience without over-engineering
- 3-4 hour timeline acceptable for Small complexity task

**Solution to Challenge 2:**
- Reviewed OBJECTIVE.md training requirements (M1 Max, CPU inference, local Qdrant)
- Added clear comments in config files explaining training choices
- Documented reasoning: "Training-optimized for M1 Max, CPU inference"
- Provided flexibility: YAML config can override .env variables

**Solution to Challenge 3:**
- Made Docker optional in setup documentation
- Setup script checks Docker availability but doesn't fail if missing
- Validation tool warns about Docker but doesn't block
- README documents both local Docker and remote Qdrant options
- Clear error messages if Qdrant unreachable

## Quality Gates

**Planning Quality Checks:**
- ✅ **AGENT_PLAN.md completeness:** All required sections present
- ✅ **TEST_PLAN.md completeness:** All 10 ACs have test procedures

## Handoff Notes

**For Negotiator:**
- W007 planning complete, ready to assign W007-B01 to Builder
- W007-B01 has no dependencies → can start immediately
- Estimated timeline: 2 hours for W007-B01

**For Builder (W007-B01):**
- **Critical:** Run W006 integration tests after each configuration change to ensure zero regressions
- **Security:** Keep .env.example free of real secrets (example values only)
- **Testing:** Test setup script in fresh environment if possible
- **Exit Gates:** After each step, verify quality gates still pass
- **Key Files:**
  - CREATE: `.env.example` (all env vars from config.py)
  - UPDATE: `config.example.yaml` (training defaults)
  - UPDATE: `docker-compose.yml` (training comments)
  - CREATE: `scripts/setup-dev.sh` (automated setup)
  - CREATE: `scripts/validate-env.py` (environment validation)

**For Tester (W007-T01):**
- Fresh environment setup test is critical (AC4, AC5)
- Zero regressions in W006 tests is mandatory (AC6)
- Documentation clarity is critical (AC8)
- Use TEST_PLAN.md test execution summary template

## Learnings

**Learning 1: Pragmatic Planning Works**
- **Description:** Pragmatic approach (between minimal and comprehensive) delivers best balance
- **Application:** For Small complexity infrastructure tasks, aim for functional + maintainable
- **Future Use:** Apply same 3-alternative evaluation pattern to similar planning tasks

**Learning 2: Training-Specific Defaults Matter**
- **Description:** Generic configuration doesn't serve training use case well
- **Application:** Always tailor defaults to primary use case (M1 Max training here)
- **Future Use:** Document reasoning for configuration choices (helps future maintainers)

**Learning 3: Environment Validation is Essential**
- **Description:** Setup automation without validation leaves developers guessing
- **Application:** Always provide `make validate-env` or similar to check prerequisites
- **Future Use:** Include validation tools in all infrastructure setup tasks

**Learning 4: Clear Documentation Reduces Setup Friction**
- **Description:** Step-by-step README instructions are critical for onboarding
- **Application:** 5-10 clear steps + troubleshooting section = good developer experience
- **Future Use:** Prioritize documentation updates in infrastructure work
