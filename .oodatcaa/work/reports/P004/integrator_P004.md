## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Merge Conflict in AGENT_REPORTS.md
**Issue:** Both main (with P002-B01 integration report) and P004 branch (with P004 documentation) added content to AGENT_REPORTS.md  
**Solution:** Manually resolved conflict by keeping both sections in correct chronological order  
**Time:** 3 minutes  
**Outcome:** Clean merge with all reports preserved

### Challenge 2: Branch Divergence
**Issue:** Main branch had diverged from origin/main  
**Solution:** Attempted git pull, then proceeded with merge and manual conflict resolution  
**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Outcome:** Successfully integrated despite divergence

### Challenge 3: Comprehensive Documentation Scope
**Issue:** P004 spanned multiple subtasks (B01, B02, B03) with different completion times  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive integrator report covering entire story  
**Time:** Integrated throughout documentation  
**Outcome:** Clear record of complete P004 story integration
