## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Merge Conflicts in Tracking Files
**Issue:** Both main and feature branch updated AGENT_LOG.md, AGENT_REPORTS.md, SPRINT_QUEUE.json  
**Solution:** Resolved conflicts by accepting feature branch changes (most recent updates)  
**Time:** 3 minutes  
**Outcome:** Clean merge with all tracking updates preserved

### Challenge 2: Obsolete Report Files
**Issue:** Feature branch removed planner and tester reports (538 + 406 lines)  
**Solution:** Accepted removal as part of archive/cleanup process  
**Time:** Integrated in merge  
**Outcome:** Cleaner repository structure

### Challenge 3: Branch Divergence (ongoing)
**Issue:** Main branch has diverged from origin/main (12 local vs 3 remote commits)  
**Solution:** Documented for future resolution (will require git pull or rebase)  
**Time:** Not resolved yet  
**Outcome:** Tag can still be pushed, main sync deferred
