## Challenges

1. **Branch Checkout Required**
   - Scripts exist on feature branch, not on main
   - Testing required checking out `feat/P003-step-01-sprint-dashboard`
   
2. **Stash Management**
   - Had to stash AGENT_LOG.md, SPRINT_QUEUE.json, and reports to switch branches
   - SPRINT_STATUS.json modified on feature branch required second stash
   
3. **Python Environment Unavailable**
   - pytest, black, ruff not installed
   - Could not run Python quality gates
   - Expected/acceptable since P003-B01 is bash script infrastructure
   
4. **Sprint ID Display Issue**
   - Dashboard shows "SPRINT-UNKNOWN" instead of "SPRINT-2025-002"
   - Builder documented as known limitation for P003-B02

---

## Solutions

1. **Branch Checkout Challenge**
   - Solution: Properly checked out feature branch for testing
   - Validated commits present (d9b4d42, 65ac473, 1eb5d6a, 16bd9b5)
   - Confirmed scripts executable and functional
   
2. **Stash Management Challenge**
   - Solution: Used git stash push with descriptive messages
   - Created multiple stashes (feature branch work, original work)
   - Successfully restored original stash after testing
   
3. **Python Environment Challenge**
   - Solution: Used bash-specific quality checks instead
   - Validated bash syntax with `bash -n`
   - Verified existing infrastructure (log rotation scripts) still works
   - Noted that Python gates not applicable to bash infrastructure tasks
   
4. **Sprint ID Display Challenge**
   - Solution: Documented as known issue, not a test failure
   - Verified Sprint ID format correct in SPRINT_QUEUE.json (SPRINT-2025-002)
   - Confirmed display fix scheduled for P003-B02
   - Added to handoff notes for Integrator

## Learnings

1. **Feature Branch Testing Critical**
   - Learning: Always test on the feature branch where code was developed
   - Application: Tester should check out feature branch before testing deliverables
   - Rationale: Code exists on feature branch, not on main until integrated
   
2. **Bash Infrastructure Requires Different Quality Gates**
   - Learning: Python quality gates (black, ruff, mypy, pytest) not applicable to bash scripts
   - Application: Use bash-specific validation (bash -n, script execution, regression tests)
   - Rationale: Different technology stacks require appropriate validation methods
   
3. **Known Limitations Can Be Acceptable**
   - Learning: Perfect implementation not always required for first PR
   - Application: Sprint ID display issue documented and deferred to P003-B02
   - Rationale: Core functionality present, cosmetic enhancements can be iterative
   
4. **Performance Testing Reveals Excellence**
   - Learning: Actual performance (0.2s, 0.02s) far exceeds targets (5s)
   - Application: Scripts are production-ready with significant performance headroom
   - Rationale: Early performance validation prevents future bottlenecks
   
5. **Atomic Operations Essential for State Management**
   - Learning: Sprint completion uses temp files + atomic rename pattern
   - Application: All OODATCAA state changes should follow this pattern
   - Rationale: Prevents partial state corruption during failures
   
6. **Regression Testing Validates Integration Safety**
   - Learning: Testing existing scripts (log rotation) confirms no breakage
   - Application: Always verify related systems still function after changes
   - Rationale: Confidence in integration safety, reduces rollback risk
