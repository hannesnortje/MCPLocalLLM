### W007 Planning Complete! 📋

**Task:** W007 - Configuration & Environment Setup  
**Complexity:** S (Small)  
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours 15 minutes (2h build + 50m docs + 15m test)  
**Dependencies:** W003 (satisfied ✅)

**Planning Duration:** 15 minutes (15:50:00 → 16:05:00)

### Plan Summary

**Problem:** MCP server needs complete configuration and environment setup for training use case:
- No .env.example template
- Docker configuration needs training mode documentation
- Configuration files need training-specific defaults
- No setup automation or validation
- Missing setup documentation

**Solution:** Pragmatic configuration setup with automation and validation

**Deliverables:**
1. `.env.example` with all environment variables documented
2. `config.example.yaml` adapted for training (CPU inference, local Qdrant)
3. `docker-compose.yml` validated with training comments
4. `scripts/setup-dev.sh` for automated setup
5. `scripts/validate-env.py` for environment validation
6. README updated with setup instructions and troubleshooting

### Implementation Plan (9 Steps)

**Step 1-6 (W007-B01): Configuration Files + Setup Scripts (~2 hours)**
1. Pre-flight setup (branch, baseline, inventory)
2. Create .env.example with all variables
3. Adapt config.example.yaml for training
4. Review/update docker-compose.yml
5. Create/update setup script
6. Create environment validation tool

**Step 7-8 (W007-B02): Documentation + Quality Gates (~50 minutes)**
7. Update README with setup instructions
8. Run quality gates and commit

**Step 9 (W007-T01): Final Validation (~15 minutes)**
9. Fresh environment test, verify all 10 ACs

### Acceptance Criteria (10 ACs)

**Functional (5 ACs):**
- AC1: `.env.example` file created with all variables documented
- AC2: Docker configuration validated for training mode
- AC3: Config files adapted for training (CPU, local Qdrant)
- AC4: Setup script functional (creates venv, installs deps, creates dirs)
- AC5: Environment validation tool (checks Python, Docker, dirs, .env)

**Quality (5 ACs):**
- AC6: All tests pass (W006 baseline maintained) ✅ CRITICAL
- AC7: Quality gates pass (black, ruff ≤28, mypy ≤401, build, security)
- AC8: Documentation updated (README with setup instructions) ✅ CRITICAL
- AC9: No secrets committed (.gitignore includes .env)
- AC10: Clean repository state (only intended files)
