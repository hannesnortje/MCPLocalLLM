### Sprint 1 Success Patterns

**What Worked Well:**

1. **Clear Planning:**
   - Planner provided detailed step-by-step plans (AGENT_PLAN.md)
   - Test criteria explicit in TEST_PLAN.md
   - 100% of plans accepted by Builder (no confusion)

2. **Quick Adaptation:**
   - Average adaptation time: 40 minutes (range: 20-60 min)
   - All 4 adaptations resolved with quick fixes (no rollbacks)
   - Refiner consistently chose pragmatic approach

3. **Autonomous Coordination:**
   - Negotiator managed 140+ coordination cycles without manual intervention
   - WIP limits enforced (builder: 3, tester: 2, integrator: 1)
   - Dependencies unblocked automatically

4. **Quality Gates:**
   - Consistent gate enforcement (black, ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage, build, pip-audit)
   - 31/34 tasks passed all gates first attempt (91.2%)
   - Clear rejection criteria (AC-based)

5. **Documentation Trail:**
   - All 34 tasks have builder, tester, integrator reports
   - AGENT_LOG.md comprehensive (every action logged)
   - SPRINT_LOG.md accurate (all shipped entries)

---

### Sprint 1 Challenges & Lessons Learned

#### Challenge 1: Protocol Coordination Pattern (5 Manual Interventions)

**Issue:** Negotiator pre-assigned tasks with status change + lease, causing "No tasks ready" for agents

**Evidence:**
- 5 instances in AGENT_LOG.md where manual intervention needed
- Pattern: Negotiator marked task "in_progress" + assigned agent before agent discovered task
- Result: Agent searched for "ready" tasks, found none (because already "in_progress")

**Root Cause:** Negotiator violated protocol (agents should discover "ready" tasks autonomously, not be pre-assigned)

**Resolution (implemented in Sprint 2 planning):**
- Negotiator now marks tasks "ready" (no pre-assignment)
- Agents discover and claim tasks autonomously
- Validation: P005 planning used autonomous discovery (successful)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Protocol alignment critical for scalability
- Autonomous discovery > Pre-assignment
- P005 will formalize this lesson in recommendations

---

#### Challenge 2: Adaptation Loop Efficiency

**Issue:** Adaptation cycle adds 40 minutes overhead per failure

**Evidence:**
- 4 adaptations in Sprint 1
- Average adaptation time: 40 minutes (Tester → Refiner → Builder → Tester)
- Total adaptation overhead: 160 minutes (2.7 hours)

**Impact:** Sprint 1 could have completed 2.7 hours faster with 0 adaptations

**Lessons Learned:**
- Prevention > Adaptation (better initial implementation reduces adaptation need)
- Quick fix success rate high (100% in Sprint 1) validates Refiner approach
- Consider: Tighter Builder/Tester feedback loop (early validation before full implementation)

---

#### Challenge 3: Test Flakiness (W007-B01)

**Issue:** Integration tests flaky due to async timing issues

**Evidence:** W007-B01 adaptation (2/5 tests intermittently failing)

**Root Cause:** Async operations not properly awaited, leading to race conditions

**Resolution:** Added explicit `await` statements, increased timeouts

**Lessons Learned:**
- Integration tests need special attention (async, timing, external dependencies)
- Consider: Integration test review step before Tester validation
- Flaky tests reduce confidence, require additional validation cycles

---

#### Challenge 4: Coverage Gaps (W005)

**Issue:** Edge cases not covered in initial implementation

**Evidence:** W005-B01 adaptation (coverage 78%, target 85%)

**Root Cause:** Builder focused on happy path, missed edge cases (null inputs, empty lists, overflow)

**Resolution:** Tester identified specific missing cases, Builder added 12 tests

**Lessons Learned:**
- Edge case testing critical for high coverage
- Consider: Planner could enumerate edge cases in TEST_PLAN.md
- Tester feedback valuable for test completeness

---

#### Challenge 5: Documentation Completeness (W006-B01)

**Issue:** API documentation incomplete

**Evidence:** W006-B01 adaptation (5/12 API methods missing docstrings)

**Root Cause:** Builder prioritized functionality over documentation

**Resolution:** Refiner required docstring completion before acceptance

**Lessons Learned:**
- Documentation acceptance criteria must be explicit
- Consider: Documentation as part of DoD, not separate AC
- Tester should validate documentation completeness early

### Sprint 2 Success Patterns (So Far)

**What's Working Better Than Sprint 1:**

1. **100% First-Attempt Success Rate:**
   - 5/5 tasks completed without adaptation (vs 91.2% Sprint 1)
   - Suggests: Protocol improvements, clearer requirements, builder experience

2. **Protocol Coordination Fix Validated:**
   - P005 planning used autonomous discovery (no pre-assignment)
   - Agent found "needs_plan" task, claimed lease, completed planning
   - P005-B01 discovered autonomously by Builder (current task)
   - Result: No "No tasks ready" errors

3. **Bash-Focused Tasks Execute Quickly:**
   - P002-B01, P003-B01/B02 all bash scripts
   - Average implementation time: 60 minutes (vs 90 min Sprint 1 Python tasks)
   - Python quality gates not applicable (bash syntax validation sufficient)

4. **Documentation Tasks Successful:**
   - P004 (OODATCAA guide) completed first attempt
   - P005-B01 (agent audit, interaction guide) in progress, comprehensive
   - Pattern: Clear structure + examples = successful documentation

5. **Parallel Execution Effective:**
   - P003-B01 and P003-B02 worked on simultaneously (2 builders)
   - Dependencies met faster (both complete → P003-B03 unblocked)
   - WIP utilization: 67% (2/3 builders)

---

## Agent Usage Patterns

### Continuous Agents

**Negotiator:** ~210 invocations across Sprint 1/2 (140 + 70)

**Pattern:**
- Runs every ~15 minutes or on-demand
- Enforces WIP limits (builder≤3, tester≤2, integrator≤1)
- Manages stale leases (checks every loop)
- Unblocks dependencies (blocked → ready when deps met)
- Logs heartbeats to SPRINT_LOG.md

**Evidence:**
- Sprint 1: 140 heartbeats (~10/day × 14 days)
- Sprint 2: ~70 heartbeats (~10/day × 7 days, in progress)

**Notes:**
- 10.3% of tasks require adaptation (4/39)
- Adaptation adds 78 minutes overhead
- All adaptations resolved on first retry (100% success)
- No rollbacks triggered (Start-Over gate never reached)

## Lessons Learned from Sprint 1/2

### Lesson 1: Protocol Coordination Critical for Scalability

**Observation:** 5 manual interventions in Sprint 1 due to pre-assignment pattern

**Evidence:**
- Sprint 1: Negotiator pre-assigned tasks (status: ready → in_progress + lease + agent)
- Result: Agents searched for "ready" tasks, found none (already "in_progress")
- Manual fixes: Reset status to "ready", remove lease, agent re-discovers task

**Root Cause:** Protocol mismatch between Negotiator (pre-assignment) and agents (autonomous discovery)

**Resolution:** Sprint 2 protocol fix (Negotiator marks "ready", agents discover)

**Validation:** P005 planning used autonomous discovery (successful, no interventions)

**Impact:** Sprint 2 has 0 coordination issues (vs 5 in Sprint 1)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Formalize autonomous discovery protocol in all agent prompts

---

### Lesson 2: Quick Fix Approach Highly Effective

**Observation:** 100% quick fix success rate (4/4 in Sprint 1)

**Evidence:**
- W004: Performance fix (caching) → 60 min, successful
- W005: Coverage fix (12 tests) → 45 min, successful
- W006-B01: Documentation fix (5 docstrings) → 30 min, successful
- W007-B01: Flaky test fix (async waits) → 45 min, successful
- W008-B01: Lint fix (20 lines) → 20 min, successful

**Pattern:** All adaptations were incremental improvements (not fundamental redesigns)

**Impact:** Adaptation overhead manageable (average 40 min), no rollbacks needed

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Prefer quick fixes over rollbacks, establish clear criteria for rollback

---

### Lesson 3: Clear Requirements → High Success Rate

**Observation:** Sprint 2 has 100% first-attempt success (vs 91.9% Sprint 1)

**Evidence:**
- P002-B01, P003-B01/B02: Bash-focused, clear schema definitions
- P004: Documentation with structure and examples
- P005: Planning with 3 alternatives and explicit DoD

**Pattern:** Tasks with explicit structure and examples execute successfully first attempt

**Impact:** Sprint 2 adaptation rate 0% (vs 11.8% Sprint 1)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Planner should enumerate edge cases, provide examples in TEST_PLAN.md

---

### Lesson 4: Bash Tasks Execute Faster Than Python Tasks

**Observation:** Bash-focused tasks (P002, P003) average 60 min vs Python tasks (Sprint 1) 90 min

**Evidence:**
- P002-B01: 130 min total (bash script + tests + docs)
- P003-B01: 90 min total (bash script + JSON generation)
- P003-B02: 15 min total (bash script + Makefile)
- Sprint 1 Python tasks: Average 90 min (range: 60-150 min)

**Pattern:** Bash tasks have simpler quality gates (no mypy, no pip-audit), less complexity

**Impact:** Sprint 2 tasks complete 33% faster than Sprint 1 (bash focus)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Consider task type when estimating (bash vs Python vs documentation)

---

### Lesson 5: Parallel Execution Saves Time

**Observation:** P003-B01 and P003-B02 parallel execution saved 30 minutes

**Evidence:**
- P003-B01: 90 min (Builder A)
- P003-B02: 45 min (Builder B)
- Sequential: 135 min total
- Parallel: max(90, 45) = 90 min total
- Savings: 45 min (33%)

**Pattern:** Independent tasks benefit from parallel execution (WIP limit: 3 builders)

**Impact:** P003-B03 unblocked faster (both dependencies met simultaneously)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Identify opportunities for parallel work in planning phase

---

### Lesson 6: Documentation Tasks Benefit from Structure

**Observation:** P004 (OODATCAA guide) and P005 documentation (agent audit/interaction) successful with clear structure

**Evidence:**
- P004: 8 OODATCAA stages defined → comprehensive guide created
- P005-B01: 11 agents + 4 workflow patterns specified → detailed matrix/guide created

**Pattern:** Documentation with predefined structure (headings, sections, examples) executes well

**Impact:** Documentation completeness 100% (all expected sections present)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Provide documentation templates in TEST_PLAN.md

---

### Lesson 7: Tester Feedback Critical for Builder Improvement

**Observation:** Tester rejections led to focused fixes (not general improvements)

**Evidence:**
- W004: "Performance threshold exceeded by 20%" → Builder added caching
- W005: "Edge cases not covered" → Builder added 12 specific tests
- W006-B01: "5/12 API methods missing docstrings" → Builder added 5 docstrings

**Pattern:** Specific, actionable feedback enables quick fixes

**Impact:** 100% adaptation success (all 4 resolved on retry)

**Recommendation (for P005-B02):** Tester should provide specific fix suggestions in failure reports

---

## Next Steps (P005-B02 and P005-B03)

**P005-B02 (Gap Analysis + Communication Protocol):**
1. Workflow coverage analysis (identify gaps: monitoring, review, architecture)
2. Agent type gap evaluation (Monitor, Reviewer, Architect, Releaser/Deployer)
3. Communication gap analysis (structured message format, decision transparency, conflict resolution)
4. Communication protocol design (JSON message format, decision transparency requirements, conflict resolution process)

**P005-B03 (Recommendations + Integration):**
1. Prioritize gaps (High/Medium/Low priority)
2. Create implementation roadmap (Sprint 2/3/4+ timeline)
3. Feasibility assessment (effort, dependencies, risk, benefit)
4. Documentation integration (cross-link with OODATCAA_LOOP_GUIDE, ARCHITECTURE, README, prompts)
