## Problem Statement

### Current State
- **Sprint 3 Complete**: MCP server infrastructure fully integrated (61 files, 12 dependencies, Qdrant configured)
- **Training Infrastructure**: None ‚Äî no training framework, no model loading, no QLoRA configuration
- **Hardware Target**: Apple M1 Max with 32GB RAM (Metal acceleration available)
- **Model Target**: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (7B parameters, instruct-tuned)
- **Training Method**: QLoRA (LoRA rank=16, alpha=32, 4-bit quantization)

### Impact
Without a training framework, we cannot:
- Fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-7B on procedural knowledge and custom definitions
- Implement daily learning cycles with overnight training
- Validate QLoRA memory constraints (‚â§16GB RAM target)
- Proceed with dataset creation and training pipeline (Sprint 4 blocks T002-T008)

### Problem
**Select and validate a training framework** for fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder-7B with QLoRA on M1 Max hardware, optimizing for:
1. **Memory Efficiency**: ‚â§16GB RAM during training (32GB available, leaving headroom)
2. **M1 Max Optimization**: Native Metal acceleration support
3. **Ease of Use**: Quick setup, good documentation, active community
4. **QLoRA Support**: Built-in LoRA/QLoRA with 4-bit quantization
5. **Model Compatibility**: Works with Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct

---

### Alternative 3: Minimal Setup (No Framework, Direct HuggingFace Transformers + LoRA)

**Description:** Use HuggingFace Transformers + PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) libraries directly without a higher-level framework.

3. **Maintenance**: Less code to maintain with framework
4. **Risk**: Higher risk of bugs in custom implementation

**Estimated Effort:** 240-360 minutes (Large complexity, beyond T001 scope)

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå **REJECT** ‚Äî Not viable within T001 timeline

---

## Chosen Alternative: MLX-LM (Alternative 1) ü•á

### Rationale

We select **Apple MLX-LM** for the following reasons:

1. **M1 Max Optimization (Critical)**: Native Metal acceleration provides significant performance advantage over PyTorch MPS backend. This is our primary hardware constraint and MLX-LM is purpose-built for it.

2. **Memory Efficiency (High Priority)**: Unified memory architecture optimization in MLX-LM aligns perfectly with our ‚â§16GB RAM target. Apple engineers tuned this specifically for M1/M2 memory characteristics.

3. **Ease of Use (Medium Priority)**: Simple `pip install mlx-lm` with minimal dependencies reduces setup complexity and risk. Estimated 60-90 minutes vs 120-150 minutes for axolotl.

4. **QLoRA Support (High Priority)**: Built-in LoRA fine-tuning with quantization examples in MLX-LM documentation. Proven to work with 7B models on M1 Max.

5. **Future-Proof (Low Priority)**: As Apple continues developing MLX, we benefit from ongoing optimizations for Apple Silicon. Aligns with local-first, M1 Max-focused objective.

### Trade-offs Accepted

- **Smaller Ecosystem**: Fewer community examples than PyTorch/axolotl (acceptable ‚Äî we can reference MLX-LM docs)
- **Portability**: Locked to M1/M2 hardware (acceptable ‚Äî OBJECTIVE.md explicitly targets M1 Max)
- **Newer Framework**: Less battle-tested than PyTorch (acceptable ‚Äî Apple backing provides confidence)

### Fallback Plan

If MLX-LM fails during implementation (e.g., model compatibility issues, unexpected memory problems):
1. **Quick validation** (30 min): Test axolotl with same proof-of-concept
2. **Switch decision** (15 min): Update plan, document switch rationale
3. **Axolotl implementation** (90 min): Follow Alternative 2 setup
4. **Total fallback cost**: ~135 minutes (still within Sprint 4 buffer)
