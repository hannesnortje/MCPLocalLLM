**Task ID:** P005  
**Objective:** SPRINT-2025-002 (OODATCAA Process Improvement)  
**Sprint:** 2  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Planner:** agent-planner-A  
**Created:** 2025-10-03T22:45:00+02:00

---

## Traceability

**Objective Link:** `.oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_2_OBJECTIVE.md` → Agent Role Completeness  
**Epic:** Sprint 2 - OODATCAA Process Improvement  
**Dependencies:** None (independent analysis task)

**Success Criteria Addressed:**
1. Agent Audit: Document current agent capabilities with role responsibilities, I/O contracts, decision authority
2. Gap Analysis: Identify missing agent types (Monitor, Architect, Reviewer, Releaser)
3. Agent Communication: Protocol improvements with structured communication and decision transparency

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 have demonstrated the OODATCAA multi-agent system successfully
- 11 agent roles currently defined across development workflow and utilities
- Agent interactions are functional but not formally documented
- No comprehensive audit of agent capabilities and boundaries
- Potential gaps in agent coverage (monitoring, architecture decisions, code review, deployment)
- Agent communication patterns are informal and implicit

**Evidence:**
- 11 agent prompt files in `.oodatcaa/prompts/` (negotiator, sprint-planner, planner, builder, tester, refiner, integrator, project-completion-detector, sprint-close, release, triage)
- Sprint 1: 34 tasks completed across 37 total (91.9% success) with 4 adaptation cycles
- Sprint 2: In progress with 4 tasks complete, demonstrating multi-agent coordination
- No formal agent capability matrix or interaction diagram
- Agent decision authority boundaries implicit in prompts
- No structured conflict resolution protocol

**Impact:**
- Unclear agent boundaries can lead to overlapping responsibilities
- Missing agent types could create workflow gaps
- Informal communication patterns increase coordination overhead
- Difficult to onboard new agent types or enhance existing ones
- No systematic way to identify agent performance issues

**Goal:**
Conduct comprehensive agent role assessment, document all capabilities and interactions, identify gaps, and propose enhancements to improve agent system completeness and communication clarity.

**Deliverable:** Evidence section in AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

**Exit Gate:** Sprint 1/2 lessons documented with specific examples

---

#### **Step 4: Gap Analysis (75 min)**
**Goal:** Identify missing agent types and capability gaps

**Tasks:**
1. **Workflow Coverage Analysis:**
   - Development workflow: Well covered (Planner → Builder → Tester → Refiner → Integrator)
   - Monitoring: ❌ No continuous monitoring agent
   - Architecture: ❌ No dedicated architecture decision agent (currently implicit in Planner)
   - Code Review: ❌ No dedicated review agent (quality gates automatic, but no human-style review)
   - Deployment: ⚠️ Release agent exists but light on deployment automation

2. **Evaluate Suggested Agent Types:**
   - **Monitor Agent:** Continuous watching of sprint progress, alerts for stale tasks
     - Gap: Yes - currently manual Negotiator runs
     - Priority: Medium (Sprint 2 daemon system helps)
     - Recommendation: Defer until P001 complete
   
   - **Architect Agent:** Design decisions, system architecture guidance
     - Gap: Unclear - Planner handles some, may need separate for complex decisions
     - Priority: Low (Planner sufficient for current needs)
     - Recommendation: Monitor Planner workload
   
   - **Reviewer Agent:** Code review beyond quality gates, style, patterns
     - Gap: Yes - quality gates catch errors but not design issues
     - Priority: Medium (especially for complex features)
     - Recommendation: Consider for Sprint 3+
   
   - **Releaser/Deployer Agent:** Full deployment automation
     - Gap: Yes - Release agent exists but limited
     - Priority: Low (project not production-ready yet)
     - Recommendation: Enhance Release agent when needed

3. **Communication Gap Analysis:**
   - Structured message format: ❌ No formal standard
   - Decision rationale: ⚠️ Logged but not structured
   - Status reporting: ⚠️ Inconsistent across agents
   - Conflict resolution: ⚠️ Informal (SPRINT_DISCUSS.md used but not formalized)

**Deliverable:** Gap analysis section in AGENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

**Exit Gate:** All gaps identified with priority and recommendations

---

#### **Step 5: Communication Protocol Design (60 min)**
**Goal:** Propose structured communication improvements

**Tasks:**

   ```json
   {
     "from_agent": "builder",
     "to_agent": "tester",
     "task_id": "P003-B01",
     "timestamp": "2025-10-03T10:00:00Z",
     "message_type": "handoff",
     "content": {
       "status": "awaiting_test",

       "quality_gates": {"black": "pass", "ruff": "pass"}
     },
     "decision_required": false
   }
   ```

2. **Decision Transparency Requirements:**
   - All agent decisions must include:
     - Decision made
     - Rationale (why this choice?)
     - Alternatives considered
     - Evidence/data used
     - Confidence level
   - Example: Refiner "quick fix vs rollback" decision

3. **Status Reporting Standards:**
   - Standardize AGENT_LOG.md entries
   - Required fields: timestamp, agent, task, action, outcome, metrics
   - Completion reports: Use template consistently
   - Executive summaries: Max 3 sentences in AGENT_REPORTS.md

4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol:**
   - When agents disagree (e.g., Tester rejects, Builder disagrees):
     - Document disagreement in SPRINT_DISCUSS.md
     - Each agent states position with rationale
     - Negotiator decides based on DoD alignment
     - Decision logged with rationale
   - Escalation: If Negotiator can't decide, defer to human
