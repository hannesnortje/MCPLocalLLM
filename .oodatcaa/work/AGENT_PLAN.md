# W008: Documentation Update — AGENT PLAN

**Task ID:** W008  
**Task Title:** Documentation Update  
**Type:** Docs  
**Complexity:** S (Small)  
**Objective:** OBJ-2025-002  
**Sprint:** 1  
**Dependencies:** W005, W006, W007 (all satisfied ✅)  

**Planner:** agent-planner-A  
**Plan Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-10-03T19:40:00+00:00

## Traceability

**Objective ID:** OBJ-2025-002 — Small Coder Model Training with MCP Integration  
**Epic:** MCP Server Foundation (Sprint 1)  
**Sprint Goal:** Migrate and integrate MCP server infrastructure  
**Sprint:** 1  

**Links to Objective:**
- OBJECTIVE.md → Documentation & Deployment → Comprehensive Documentation
- SPRINT_GOAL.md → Exit Criteria #5: Documentation Complete
- Sprint completion requirement: W008 is the final task

---

## Problem Statement

Sprint 1 has successfully migrated and integrated the MCP server (W001-W007), but the project documentation is incomplete:

1. **No MCP integration overview** — Developers don't understand what MCP is or why we use it
2. **Missing architecture section** — No explanation of how MCP enables the training workflow
3. **No migration story** — The W001-W007 journey isn't documented for future reference
4. **Incomplete README structure** — Duplicated sections, missing MCP-specific quick start
5. **Broken links** — Some references to old structure (`PYTemplate` in Quick Start)
6. **No link to MCP docs** — Comprehensive docs exist in `docs/mcp/` but aren't referenced

This blocks new developers from understanding the MCP integration and limits project onboarding effectiveness.

---

## Constraints & Interfaces

### Constraints
- **Must preserve W007 setup section** — Excellent setup documentation already exists
- **Sprint 1 completion gate** — W008 is the final task before sprint retrospective
- **Documentation clarity** — Must be accessible to developers unfamiliar with MCP
- **No code changes** — Documentation-only task, zero code modifications
- **Existing docs preserved** — All docs in `docs/mcp/` stay unchanged

### Interfaces
- **README.md** — Primary project documentation (main interface)
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Already comprehensive (W001-W007 documented)
- **docs/mcp/** — Existing MCP technical documentation (reference but don't modify)
- **SPRINT_GOAL.md** — Sprint exit criteria reference

### Risks
- **Documentation length** — README becoming too long (mitigated: use sections with clear navigation)
- **Technical depth** — Too much detail could overwhelm (mitigated: high-level overview with links)
- **Maintenance** — Documentation becoming stale (mitigated: clear structure and links)

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

### Functional Requirements
1. ✅ **MCP Integration section added** to README with overview, benefits, architecture
2. ✅ **Architecture section** explaining MCP role in training workflow
3. ✅ **Migration journey documented** (W001-W007 story) with reference to CHANGELOG
4. ✅ **README structure improved** (remove duplication, fix broken references)
5. ✅ **MCP documentation links** added (point to docs/mcp/ for details)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. ✅ **Zero code changes** (documentation-only task)
2. ✅ **All quality gates pass** (no regressions)
3. ✅ **Clear navigation** (table of contents or clear sections)
4. ✅ **Consistent formatting** (markdown best practices)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Minimal Documentation Update (Rejected)
**Approach:** Only add MCP overview section, skip architecture and migration story  
**Pros:** Fastest (30 min)  
**Cons:**
- Incomplete sprint exit criteria
- Poor onboarding for new developers
- Missing key context on why MCP was chosen
- Doesn't explain training workflow

### Alternative 2: Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul (Rejected)
**Approach:** Rewrite entire README, create new architecture docs, detailed diagrams  
**Pros:** Complete, professional, comprehensive  
**Cons:**
- Over-engineering for Sprint 1 completion
- 8-12 hours of work (too much for Small task)
- Risk of introducing errors
- Delays sprint completion

### Alternative 3: Structured Documentation Update (SELECTED) ✅
**Approach:**
- Add MCP integration overview (50-100 lines)
- Add architecture section (50-80 lines)
- Document migration journey with CHANGELOG reference (30-50 lines)
- Clean up README structure (remove duplication, fix references)
- Add MCP documentation links section

**Pros:**
- Completes all Sprint 1 exit criteria
- Provides essential context for new developers
- Reasonable timeline (1.5-2 hours total)
- Good balance of completeness and efficiency
- Preserves existing good documentation (W007 setup)

**Cons:**
- Not as minimal as Alt 1
- Not as comprehensive as Alt 2

**Rationale:** Alternative 3 achieves sprint completion requirements while providing essential developer onboarding context. The 1.5-2 hour timeline is appropriate for a Small complexity documentation task completing a sprint.
