### 2025-10-01 - Sprint 1 Initiated by Sprint Planner

**Sprint Goal:** Establish project foundation with complete MCP server migration, ensuring core memory management and vector search capabilities are operational.

**Rationale:**
- MCP server migration is the critical foundation for all subsequent work
- OBJECTIVE.md explicitly requires copying from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
- Must establish quality gates and infrastructure before building training system
- Estimated to achieve 25% of overall objective completion

**Expected Outcomes:**
1. ✅ MCP server fully migrated and operational
2. ✅ Core functionality verified (memory, vector search, policies)
3. ✅ Quality gates passing (black, ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage ≥85%)
4. ✅ Basic Cursor IDE integration working
5. ✅ Qdrant vector database operational
6. ✅ Documentation foundation complete

**Work Items Created:** 8 tasks (W001-W008)
- 2 Critical Path (P0): File migration, dependency consolidation
- 4 High Priority (P1): Cleanup, verification, MCP protocol, quality gates
- 2 Medium Priority (P2): Documentation, Qdrant setup

**Next Action:** Launch Negotiator to coordinate Planner agent for task detailing

**Risks Identified:**
- File conflicts during migration (Medium) → Preserve .oodatcaa/, prioritize MCP files
- Dependency compatibility (Medium) → Early consolidation and testing
- MCP protocol complexity (Medium) → Start with basic stdin/stdout tests
