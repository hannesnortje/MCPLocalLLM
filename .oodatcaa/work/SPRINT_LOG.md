## Sprint 3 Initiated

### 2025-10-05T16:00:00Z | 🚀 SPRINT 3 PLANNING COMPLETE - MCP Server Foundation 🚀

**Sprint Planner:** Autonomous sprint goal generation executed per `.oodatcaa/prompts/sprint-planner.md`

**Sprint 3 Goal:** MCP Server Foundation — Migrate and integrate MCP server infrastructure

**Rationale:**
- Sprint 2 delivered excellent OODATCAA process infrastructure (~15,000 lines)
- However, core objective (MCP integration + training system) not yet started
- Sprint 3 returns to primary objective: MCP Server Migration (original Sprint 1 goal, deferred)
- This is the **blocking dependency** for all training work (Sprints 4+)

**Objective Progress:** ~10% → ~25% (MCP Foundation milestone)

**Exit Criteria (6 total):**
1. **MCP server successfully copied and adapted** from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
2. **Core MCP functionality operational** (memory, policy, vector storage)
3. **Project structure integrated** (coexists with `src/mdnotes/`, quality gates pass)
4. **Configuration updated** (pyproject.toml, Docker/Qdrant)
5. **Initial documentation complete** (README, setup, architecture, troubleshooting)
6. **Clean CI state** (black, ruff, mypy, pytest pass, no security issues)

**Work Items (8 total):**
- W001: Analyze MCP Source Structure (M, 90-120 min) - READY
- W002: Execute MCP Server Migration (L, 180-240 min) - blocked by W001
- W003: Integrate MCP Dependencies (M, 90-120 min) - blocked by W002
- W004: Adapt MCP for Training Use Case (M, 120-150 min) - blocked by W002, W003
- W005: Python Tooling & Quality Gates (L, 180-240 min) - blocked by W002, W003, W004
- W006: Basic Integration Testing (M, 120-150 min) - blocked by W005
- W007: Configuration & Environment Setup (M, 90-120 min) - blocked by W003, W004
- W008: Documentation Update (M, 120-150 min) - blocked by W002, W006, W007

**Critical Path:** W001 → W002 → W003 → W004 → W005 → W006 → W008

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Phase 5: W005 (Quality) + W007 (Config) can run in parallel after W004

**Estimated Total Time:** 1,140-1,560 minutes (19-26 hours)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Complete MCP server migrated and operational
- Vector storage (Qdrant) configured and accessible
- Memory management and policy systems functional
- Quality gates passing (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
- Documentation updated with MCP integration guides
- Zero regressions in existing functionality

**Timeline:**
- **Start:** 2025-10-05
- **Target Completion:** 2025-10-15 (7-10 working days)

**Risk Assessment:** Medium
- File conflicts (mitigated: preserve `.oodatcaa/`, incremental validation)
- Dependency incompatibilities (mitigated: test in clean venv)
- Breaking existing tooling (mitigated: run full test suite)

**Files Updated:**
- `.oodatcaa/objectives/SPRINT_GOAL.md` - Sprint 3 goal defined
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md` - 8 work items detailed
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_QUEUE.json` - Sprint 3 queue initialized
- `.oodatcaa/work/SPRINT_LOG.md` - Sprint 3 logged

**Next Actions:**
1. Negotiator will assign W001 to Planner for detailed planning
2. Planner will create AGENT_PLAN.md and TEST_PLAN.md for W001
3. Builder will execute W001 analysis and create migration plan
4. Sequential execution: W001 → W002 → ... → W008

**Status:** ✅ Sprint 3 Planning Complete - Ready for Execution

**Exit Criteria (6 total):**
1. **Training dataset created** with 1,000-5,000 instruction-input-output examples
2. **QLoRA training environment configured** for M1 Max (axolotl or MLX-LM)
3. **Dataset validation pipeline working** (schema, quality, diversity checks)
4. **Training infrastructure tested** (dry-run, profiling, quantization)
5. **Documentation complete** (dataset format, QLoRA config, workflow)
6. **Integration with MCP validated** (context patterns, embedding compatibility)

**Work Items (8 total):**
- T001: Training Framework Research & Selection (M, 120-180 min) - NEEDS_PLAN
