## Current Sprint

### Sprint 1: MCP Server Foundation
**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** 2025-10-01  
**Goal:** Migrate and integrate MCP server from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to establish core context preservation infrastructure  
**Expected Completion:** 2025-10-11 (10 working days)

**Rationale:**  
Following OBJECTIVE.md Implementation Strategy Phase 1, this sprint establishes the critical MCP foundation that all subsequent training, context preservation, and daily learning features depend on. Without MCP infrastructure, we cannot implement dual-layer context preservation or agent coordination.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Complete MCP server migration with file conflict resolution
- Core functionality operational: memory management, vector storage, policy system
- Python tooling passes (black, ruff, mypy) on migrated code
- Basic integration tests pass
- Configuration and documentation complete

**Objective Progress:** 0% → ~15% (Foundation milestone complete)
