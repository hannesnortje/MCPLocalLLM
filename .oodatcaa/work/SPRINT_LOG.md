# Sprint Log — Project History (AGENT-GENERATED)

> **This file tracks sprint summaries and key decisions.** Updated by Negotiator and Sprint Planner.

**Status:** No sprints yet — Launch the Negotiator to begin!

## Example Sprint Entries (What Agents Will Log)

### Sprint 1 — Foundation (Oct 1-8, 2025) — ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Establish CLI framework and basic indexing

**Shipped:**
- W001: Project structure (pyproject.toml, src/mdnotes/, tests/)
- W002: CLI entry point with Click (`mdnotes --help` works)
- W003: Development tooling (black, ruff, mypy, CI)
- W004: File discovery for .md files (recursive, respects .gitignore)

**Metrics:**
- Velocity: 4/4 tasks completed (100%)
- Duration: 6 days (under 7-day estimate)
- Coverage: 87% (above 85% threshold)
- PRs merged: 4
- Tag: v0.1.0-alpha

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose Click over Typer (better docs, more mature)
- Used pathlib for cross-platform path handling
- Added progress bars with rich (nicer than tqdm)

**Objective Progress:** 0% → 20% ✅

---

### Sprint 2 — Core Indexing (Oct 9-18, 2025) — ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Implement full-text search with Whoosh and core CLI commands

**Shipped:**
- W005: Markdown parser with metadata extraction
- W006: Search index with Whoosh (p95 = 320ms, well under 500ms)
- W007: `mdnotes index` command with progress bar
- W008: `mdnotes search` command with fuzzy matching

**Metrics:**
- Velocity: 4/4 tasks (100%)
- Duration: 9 days
- Performance: Search p95 = 320ms ✅ (target < 500ms)
- Coverage: 89%
- PRs merged: 4
- Tag: v0.2.0-alpha

**Rolled Back:**
- W005 Step 02 — Initial regex parser too fragile, switched to python-markdown library

**Key Decisions:**
- Used python-markdown instead of custom parser (more reliable)
- SQLite for metadata cache (faster than re-parsing on every search)
- Added fuzzy matching with fuzzywuzzy (better UX)

**Objective Progress:** 20% → 60% ✅

---

### Sprint 3 — Links & Graph (Oct 19-28, 2025) — 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Implement backlinks and knowledge graph visualization

**In Progress:**
- W009: Backlink resolution ✅ DONE
- W010: NetworkX graph generation 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- W011: D3.js HTML visualization ⏳ NOT STARTED

**Current Status:**
- Day 6/10
- WIP: 2 builders, 1 tester
- Blocked: W011 waiting for W010

**Objective Progress:** 60% → 85% (projected)

## Project Timeline

| Sprint | Dates | Goal | Status | Progress |
|--------|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Oct 1 | Init | ✅ Complete | 0% |
| 1 | Oct 1-8 | Foundation | ✅ Complete | 20% |

## Cumulative Metrics
- **Total Sprints:** 2 complete, 1 in progress
- **Velocity:** 8 tasks / 2 sprints = 4 tasks per sprint
- **Coverage:** 87-89% (consistently above 85%)
- **Performance:** All benchmarks met
- **Rollbacks:** 1 minor (W005 Step 02)
- **Objective Progress:** 60% → 100% (projected completion Nov 5)

---

## Improvements for Future Sprints
- Builder-A and Builder-B work well in parallel (continue)
- Add Refiner earlier when rollback risk detected
- Pre-plan next sprint during current sprint (smoother transitions)
- Add benchmark tests earlier (caught perf issue in Sprint 2)
