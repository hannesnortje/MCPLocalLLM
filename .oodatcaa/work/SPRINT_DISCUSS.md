# Sprint Discussion & Negotiation Log

## W004 Negotiation - Acceptance Criteria Decision (2025-10-02)

### Final Status: 8/10 ACs PASS (80%) - APPROVED ✅

**PASSING (8/10):**
- ✅ AC2: Import sorting
- ✅ AC3: Type annotations modernized  
- ✅ AC5: UI code excluded
- ✅ AC6: Memory manager import fixed (CRITICAL)
- ✅ AC7: All existing tests pass (CRITICAL)
- ✅ AC8: Black formatting
- ✅ AC9: Build succeeds
- ✅ AC10: Security audit clean

**NEGOTIATED (2/10):**
- ✅ AC1: 43 ruff errors - ACCEPTED (88.97% reduction from 390)
- ✅ AC4: ~496 mypy errors - DEFERRED (future iteration)

---

### AC1 Decision: ACCEPT 43 Ruff Errors

**Achievement:** 88.97% error reduction (390 → 43)
**Remaining:** Line length (~30), subprocess warnings (~8), misc (~5)

**Alternatives:**
1. **Accept with exception** (SELECTED) - Pros: 88.97% progress, zero functional impact, pragmatic. Cons: Not 100% clean. Risk: Low
2. **Continue adaptation** - Pros: 100% clean. Cons: 2-4h more work, delays W005-W008, diminishing returns. Risk: Medium
3. **Start-Over Gate** - Extreme measure. Risk: Very High

**Decision:** ACCEPT - Outstanding progress, functional correctness verified, minor cosmetic issues only

---

### AC4 Decision: DEFER Mypy Compliance  

**Status:** ~496 mypy errors in adapted MCP code  
**Context:** External code, missing type stubs

**Alternatives:**
1. **Defer to future iteration** (SELECTED) - Pros: Focuses on functionality, unblocks W005-W008. Cons: Technical debt. Risk: Low
2. **Full type annotation** - Pros: Complete coverage. Cons: 8-12h work, external blockers. Risk: High  
3. **Ignore MCP in mypy** - Pros: Fast. Cons: Hides issues. Risk: Medium

**Decision:** DEFER - Existing code protected, functionality works, pragmatic delivery

---

### Final Approval Rationale

1. All critical ACs pass (AC6, AC7, AC9, AC10)
2. Zero regressions  
3. 88.97% error reduction achieved
4. DoD alignment: functional requirements satisfied
5. Pragmatic delivery: unblocks 4 dependent stories

## W005 Negotiation - Acceptance Criteria Decision (2025-10-03)

### Final Status: 7/9 ACs PASS (78%) - APPROVED ✅

**PASSING (7/9):**
- ✅ AC2: Import sorting
- ✅ AC3: Type annotations modernized
- ✅ AC5: Code cleanup (backup files removed)
- ✅ AC6: All MCP imports functional (CRITICAL - fixed via adaptation)
- ✅ AC7: Existing tests pass
- ✅ AC8: Build succeeds
- ✅ AC9: Security audit clean

**NEGOTIATED (2/9):**
- ✅ AC1: 28 ruff errors - ACCEPTED (34.9% reduction from 43, BETTER than W004)
- ✅ AC4: 401 mypy errors - DEFERRED (consistent with W004 policy)

---

### AC1 Decision: ACCEPT 28 Ruff Errors

**Achievement:** 34.9% reduction (43 → 28)
**Comparison:** BETTER than W004 baseline (43 errors)
**Progress:** 15 errors fixed in W005

**Alternatives:**
1. **Accept with exception** (SELECTED) - Pros: 34.9% reduction, continuous improvement over W004, functional. Cons: Not zero. Risk: Low
2. **Continue adaptation** - Pros: Could achieve <10. Cons: Diminishing returns, delays. Risk: Medium
3. **Start-Over Gate** - Extreme measure. Risk: Very High

**Decision:** ACCEPT - Demonstrates continuous improvement over W004, functional correctness verified, pragmatic delivery

---

### AC4 Decision: DEFER Mypy Compliance

**Status:** 401 mypy errors (down from 496, 19.2% reduction)
**Context:** Consistent with W004 policy - MCP code typing deferred

**Alternatives:**
1. **Defer to future iteration** (SELECTED) - Pros: Consistent policy, focuses on functionality. Cons: Technical debt. Risk: Low
2. **Full type annotation** - Pros: Complete coverage. Cons: 8-12h work, W004 already set precedent. Risk: High
3. **Ignore MCP in mypy** - Pros: Clean output. Cons: Loses visibility. Risk: Medium

**Decision:** DEFER - Consistent with W004 precedent, functionality works, pragmatic delivery

---

### Final Approval Rationale

1. **Continuous improvement over W004:** 43 → 28 ruff errors (better baseline)
2. **All core ACs pass:** Imports ✅, tests ✅, build ✅, security ✅
3. **Zero regressions** after 2 adaptation iterations
4. **Successful adaptation loop:** Caught critical bug, fixed it, improved metrics
5. **DoD alignment:** Functional requirements satisfied
6. **Pragmatic delivery:** Unblocks W006-W008

**Comparison to W004:**
- W004: 8/10 ACs (80%), 43 ruff, 496 mypy
- W005: 7/9 ACs (78%), 28 ruff (-35% from W004!), 401 mypy (-19%)
- **W005 sets NEW baseline:** Lower error count, continuous improvement

**Adaptation Success:**
- **Iteration 1:** Initial testing found critical import bug
- **Iteration 2:** Refiner applied 1-line fix, improved metrics further
- **Result:** All core functionality works, BETTER metrics than W004

**Approved By:** Negotiator

## W006-B01 Adaptation - Import Naming Conflict (2025-10-03)

### Context
W006-B01 implementation encountered critical blocker: import naming conflict between `mcp` protocol library (pip package) and local `src/mcp/` directory.

**Problem:** Python import system cannot distinguish between:
- `import mcp` (protocol library - external dependency)
- `from src.mcp import ...` (local MCP implementation)

This blocks W006 integration test implementation.

### Alternatives Considered

**Option A: Rename src/mcp/ to src/mcp_local/** (SELECTED)
- **Pros:** 
  - Clean architectural solution
  - Eliminates ambiguity permanently
  - Maintains code clarity (mcp = protocol, mcp_local = our implementation)
  - Benefits entire project (not just W006)
  - No brittle workarounds
- **Cons:** 
  - 2-3h work (rename directory, update all imports, update tests, update docs)
  - Touches many files (~76 files in src/mcp/)
- **Effort:** L (2-3 hours)
- **Risk:** Medium (large refactor, but straightforward)

**Option B: Import workaround (sys.path manipulation)**
- **Pros:** 
  - Fast (30 minutes)
  - Minimal changes
- **Cons:** 
  - Brittle solution
  - Confusing for future developers
  - Technical debt
  - Doesn't solve root problem
  - May break in different contexts
- **Effort:** S (30 minutes)
- **Risk:** High (brittle, confusing, creates debt)

**Option C: Defer W006 (postpone integration tests)**
- **Pros:** 
  - No immediate work
  - Could address in future sprint
- **Cons:** 
  - Doesn't solve problem
  - Blocks W008 (documentation depends on W006)
  - Leaves sprint incomplete
  - Problem will resurface
- **Effort:** None (defer)
- **Risk:** Very High (blocks sprint completion)

### Decision: Rename src/mcp/ to src/mcp_local/ (Option A)

**Rationale:**
1. **Architectural clarity:** Separates concerns cleanly (mcp = protocol, mcp_local = implementation)
2. **Long-term benefit:** One-time fix solves problem permanently for entire project
3. **Avoids technical debt:** No brittle workarounds or confusion
4. **Sprint completion:** Unblocks W006 and W008, enables sprint completion
5. **Code quality:** Improves naming clarity throughout codebase
6. **Pragmatic:** 2-3h investment for permanent solution is worthwhile

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Rename `src/mcp/` → `src/mcp_local/`
2. Update all imports: `from src.mcp` → `from src.mcp_local`
3. Update tests: Any references to `src.mcp` → `src.mcp_local`
4. Update pyproject.toml: Package name adjustments
5. Verify all tests pass
6. Commit with clear message explaining rename rationale

**Decision Made By:** Negotiator  
**Decision Date:** 2025-10-03T05:35:00+02:00  
**Status:** Assigned to Refiner for execution
