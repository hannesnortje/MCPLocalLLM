### AC1 Decision: ACCEPT 43 Ruff Errors

**Achievement:** 88.97% error reduction (390 → 43)
**Remaining:** Line length (~30), subprocess warnings (~8), misc (~5)

**Alternatives:**
1. **Accept with exception** (SELECTED) - Pros: 88.97% progress, zero functional impact, pragmatic. Cons: Not 100% clean. Risk: Low
2. **Continue adaptation** - Pros: 100% clean. Cons: 2-4h more work, delays W005-W008, diminishing returns. Risk: Medium
3. **Start-Over Gate** - Extreme measure. Risk: Very High

**Decision:** ACCEPT - Outstanding progress, functional correctness verified, minor cosmetic issues only

### AC4 Decision: DEFER Mypy Compliance  

**Status:** ~496 mypy errors in adapted MCP code  
**Context:** External code, missing type stubs

**Alternatives:**
1. **Defer to future iteration** (SELECTED) - Pros: Focuses on functionality, unblocks W005-W008. Cons: Technical debt. Risk: Low
2. **Full type annotation** - Pros: Complete coverage. Cons: 8-12h work, external blockers. Risk: High  
3. **Ignore MCP in mypy** - Pros: Fast. Cons: Hides issues. Risk: Medium

**Decision:** DEFER - Existing code protected, functionality works, pragmatic delivery

### Final Approval Rationale

1. All critical ACs pass (AC6, AC7, AC9, AC10)
2. Zero regressions  
3. 88.97% error reduction achieved
4. DoD alignment: functional requirements satisfied
5. Pragmatic delivery: unblocks 4 dependent stories

**Approved By:** Negotiator  
**Date:** 2025-10-02T23:00:00+02:00  
**Next:** W004 → Integrator (PR + merge + tag + CHANGELOG)
