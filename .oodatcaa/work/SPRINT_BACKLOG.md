## Work Items

### W001: MCP Server File Migration
**Type:** Infra
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Complexity:** M
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Copy complete MCP server structure from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to this project, resolving any file conflicts while preserving the OODATCAA system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All MCP server files successfully copied to project root
- File conflicts resolved (prioritize MCP files, preserve `.oodatcaa/` directory)
- Directory structure matches MCP server organization
- No duplicate or conflicting files remain

### W002: Dependency Consolidation
**Type:** Infra
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Complexity:** S
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Merge dependencies from MCP server with existing project requirements, creating a unified requirements.txt and updating pyproject.toml accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single consolidated requirements.txt with all dependencies
- pyproject.toml updated with correct package metadata
- No dependency conflicts
- All dependencies install cleanly on M1 Max

### W003: Package Renaming & Cleanup
**Type:** TechDebt
**Priority:** P1
**Complexity:** M
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Rename package from "mcp-memory-server" to "mcp-local-llm" and remove unnecessary features not needed for the training system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Package renamed throughout codebase (imports, configs, docs)
- UI components and unnecessary features removed
- Core functionality preserved: memory management, vector search, policy system
- All import paths updated and working

### W004: Core Functionality Verification
**Type:** Quality
**Priority:** P1
**Complexity:** M
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Verify that migrated MCP server's core functionality works correctly: memory management, vector search, and policy system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Memory management tests pass (create, read, update, delete)
- Vector search with Qdrant operational
- Policy system enforcing rules correctly
- Unit tests achieve ≥85% line coverage
- Integration tests for core features pass

### W005: MCP Protocol Communication
**Type:** Story
**Priority:** P1
**Complexity:** M
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Implement basic MCP protocol communication with Cursor IDE using stdin/stdout, including tool definitions and error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- stdin/stdout communication established
- Tool definitions registered and callable
- Basic resource handlers implemented
- Error handling and recovery working
- Simple integration test with Cursor passes

### W006: Quality Gates Setup
**Type:** Quality
**Priority:** P1
**Complexity:** S
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Ensure all quality gates pass: black, ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage, build, and pip-audit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `black --check .` passes
- `ruff check .` passes with 0 errors
- `mypy .` passes (strict mode)
- `pytest` passes with ≥85% coverage
- `python -m build` succeeds
- `pip-audit` shows 0 high-severity issues

### W007: Documentation Foundation
**Type:** Docs
**Priority:** P2
**Complexity:** S
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Update README with project overview, installation instructions, and basic usage. Document MCP server migration and setup process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- README updated with project vision and setup instructions
- MCP server configuration documented
- Architecture overview diagram created
- Setup guide for M1 Max environment
- Troubleshooting section for common issues

### W008: Qdrant Vector Database Setup
**Type:** Infra
**Priority:** P2
**Complexity:** S
**Assigned:** Needs planning

**Description:**
Set up Qdrant vector database with Docker container and configure for embedding storage and retrieval.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Qdrant running in Docker container
- Collection created with correct embedding dimensions (384)
- Connection from MCP server verified

## Task Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 8
- **Critical Path (P0):** 2 tasks
- **High Priority (P1):** 4 tasks
- **Medium Priority (P2):** 2 tasks
- **Estimated Complexity:** 3S + 5M = ~7-10 days
