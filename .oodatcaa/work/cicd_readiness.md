make check        # Full validation
make build        # python -m build
make audit        # pip-audit
make sprint-status # Sprint dashboard
```

**CI Compatibility:** ✅ All commands are CLI-based, exit codes available  
**Issue:** Some commands may require tool installation first

---

#### 2. Quality Gate Scripts

- ✅ Good Python support
- ✅ Easy secrets management

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited to GitHub ecosystem
- ❌ Can be expensive for heavy private repo usage

**Verdict:** **RECOMMENDED** for Sprint 3 implementation

---

### GitLab CI (Alternative)
**Pros:**
