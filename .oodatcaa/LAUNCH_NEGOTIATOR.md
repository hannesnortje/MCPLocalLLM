Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules.
Read the MANDATORY output format section in @Cursor Rules (python.mdc).
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/negotiator.md exactly.
Your response MUST end with the exact format from python.mdc showing "ðŸŽ¯ NEXT ACTION REQUIRED" with a copy-paste code block.
Return only file diffs.
```

âœ… Agent name clearly stated
âœ… Code block with exact command to copy-paste
âœ… "Run as: Background" or "Once (not in background)"
