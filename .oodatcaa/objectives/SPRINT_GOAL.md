# Current Sprint Goal (AGENT-GENERATED)

> **This file is managed by agents.** The Sprint Planner agent generates sprint goals based on OBJECTIVE.md.
> 
> **Status:** Awaiting first sprint planning — Launch the Negotiator to begin!

## Sprint 0 — Project Initialization (Example Template)

**Goal:** *Agents will generate the first sprint goal based on your OBJECTIVE.md*

**Exit Criteria (will be auto-generated)**
- [ ] Project structure established
- [ ] Development tooling configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] First smoke test passing

**Timebox:** TBD by agents  
**Status:** `awaiting_planning`  
**Last Coordinator Check:** 2025-10-01T00:01Z  
**Owner:** Negotiator (Coordinator)  
**Objective Progress:** 0% toward completion

## How Sprints Work

When you launch the Negotiator, it will:
1. Check this file — sees no sprint exists
2. Trigger the Sprint Planner agent
3. Sprint Planner will analyze OBJECTIVE.md success criteria
4. Generate Sprint 1 with specific, achievable goals
5. Estimate timeline (typically 7-14 days)
6. Create backlog tasks in SPRINT_BACKLOG.md

Each sprint advances toward completing your objective's success criteria.

## Sprint Planning Template (What Agents Generate)

```markdown
## Sprint 1 — Foundation (Oct 1-8, 2025)
**Goal:** Establish project foundation — CLI framework, basic indexing, first tests

**Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] AC-1: CLI entry point works (`mdnotes --help` shows usage)
- [ ] AC-2: Basic indexing reads .md files from a directory
- [ ] AC-3: Unit tests for core modules pass
- [ ] DoD: black/ruff/mypy pass; 85% coverage; CI green
- [ ] DoD: Tagged as v0.1.0-alpha

**Timebox:** 7 days  
**Status:** in_progress  
**Objective Progress:** 20%

### Sprint Planning Notes:
- Selected: Foundation components (CLI, indexing basics)
- Dependencies: None (first sprint)
- Risk: Low (standard Python tooling)
- Estimated: Oct 8, 2025
```
