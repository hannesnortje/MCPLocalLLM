## Sprint 1: Foundation & MCP Server Migration

**Status:** `planning`
**Started:** 2025-10-01
**Timebox:** 7-10 working days
**Objective Progress:** 0% → Target 25%

### Goal
Establish project foundation with complete MCP server migration, ensuring core memory management and vector search capabilities are operational.

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] MCP server successfully copied and adapted from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
- [ ] Core functionality verified: memory management, vector search, policy system
- [ ] Project structure clean with no file conflicts
- [ ] All quality gates pass: black, ruff, mypy, pytest (with ≥85% coverage)
- [ ] Basic integration test with Cursor IDE communication working
- [ ] Documentation updated: README, setup instructions, architecture overview

### Addresses Objective Components
- ✅ MCP Integration Layer (Critical - Line 72-90 of OBJECTIVE.md)
  - Server Migration (Line 73-78)
  - Protocol Compliance (Line 85-89)
- ✅ Quality & Performance foundations (Line 118-135)
- ✅ Documentation foundations (Line 138-143)

### Dependencies
- Access to source MCP server at `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
- Python environment with required dependencies
- Qdrant vector database setup

### Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Medium
- **File Conflicts:** May conflict with existing template structure → Mitigation: Preserve .oodatcaa/ system, prioritize MCP files
- **Dependency Issues:** New dependencies from MCP server → Mitigation: Create consolidated requirements.txt early
- **Integration Complexity:** MCP protocol setup → Mitigation: Start with basic stdin/stdout tests
