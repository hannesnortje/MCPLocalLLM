## Sprint 3: MCP Server Foundation

**Status:** `completed`  
**Started:** 2025-10-02  
**Completed:** 2025-10-03T05:00:00+02:00
**Actual Duration:** ~27 hours (1 day, ahead of schedule!)
**Objective Progress:** ~10% → ~25% (MCP Foundation milestone achieved!)

### Goal
Migrate and integrate the MCP server from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to establish the core context preservation and memory management infrastructure required for training system.

### Exit Criteria
1. **MCP server successfully copied and adapted** from source repository
   - All essential files migrated without breaking OODATCAA system
   - File conflicts resolved (MCP files take precedence, preserve `.oodatcaa/`)
   - Package renamed from "mcp-memory-server" to "mcp-local-llm"

2. **Core MCP functionality operational**
   - Memory management system working (vector storage, retrieval)
   - Policy system intact (preservation levels, rule compliance)
   - Dependencies installed and compatible with this project
   - Qdrant vector database configured and accessible

3. **Project structure integrated**
   - MCP server coexists with existing `src/mdnotes/` module
   - Python tooling passes: black, ruff, mypy (on new MCP code)
   - Basic smoke tests pass for MCP components
   - No regressions in existing functionality

4. **Configuration updated**
   - `pyproject.toml` includes MCP dependencies
   - Docker/Qdrant configuration ready
   - Environment setup documented
   - Development environment validated

5. **Initial documentation complete**
   - README updated with MCP integration overview
   - Setup instructions for MCP server
   - Architecture notes on how MCP enables training workflow
   - Troubleshooting guide for common MCP issues

6. **Clean CI state**
   - All quality gates pass: black --check, ruff, mypy
   - Basic pytest suite runs successfully
   - No high-severity security issues (pip-audit)
   - MCP server can initialize and respond to basic commands

### Objective Components Addressed
This sprint delivers **MCP Integration (Critical)** success criteria:
- Server Migration: Copy complete `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` structure
- Clean and adapt for small coder training project
- Maintain core functionality: memory, vector search, policy system
- Update dependencies and configuration
- Resolve file conflicts between MCP and existing project

### Dependencies
**Prerequisites:** Sprint 2 complete (OODATCAA process infrastructure operational)  
**Enables:** Sprint 4+ (training system, context preservation, daily learning)

### Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- **File conflicts:** Preserve `.oodatcaa/` system files, prioritize MCP server files for conflicts
- **Dependency incompatibilities:** Test in isolated venv, use compatible versions
- **Breaking existing tooling:** Run full test suite before/after migration
- **Incomplete migration:** Create checklist of essential MCP components before copying
- **Integration complexity:** Incremental migration with validation at each step

## Sprint History

### Sprint 4 (Current)
- **Goal:** Training System Foundation - Dataset creation and QLoRA setup
- **Status:** `planning`
- **Started:** 2025-10-05
- **Expected Completion:** 2025-10-15 (7-10 working days)
- **Objective Progress:** ~25% → ~45% (Training Foundation milestone)

#### Goal
Establish the core training infrastructure for fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder-7B with procedural knowledge, custom definitions, and context preservation patterns. Create initial training dataset (1k-5k examples) and configure QLoRA training environment for M1 Max.

#### Exit Criteria
1. **Training dataset created** with 1,000-5,000 instruction-input-output examples
   - Procedural knowledge examples (error handling, tool usage, commit conventions)
   - Custom definitions (e.g., "42 = harmony between rules and freedom")
   - Context window replacement patterns
   - Metadata tagging examples (strict/moderate/flexible preservation levels)
   - Rule compliance markers (concept:*, pattern:*, definition:*)

2. **QLoRA training environment configured** for M1 Max
   - Training framework selected and installed (axolotl or Apple MLX-LM)
   - Configuration files created (LoRA rank=16, alpha=32)
   - Model download and setup (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct base model)
   - Memory optimization validated (≤16GB RAM target)
   - Training scripts ready for execution

3. **Dataset validation pipeline working**
   - Schema validation (instruction-input-output format)
   - Quality checks (length, completeness, diversity)
   - Context pattern validation
   - Metadata consistency checks
   - Train/validation split (80/20)

4. **Training infrastructure tested**
   - Dry-run training successful (1-10 examples)
   - Resource usage profiling (CPU, RAM, disk)
   - Training time estimation validated
   - Checkpoint saving/loading working
   - Model quantization pipeline tested (GGUF Q4_K_M)

5. **Documentation complete**
   - Training dataset format and examples documented
   - QLoRA configuration explained
   - Training workflow documented (data prep → train → validate → quantize)
   - Troubleshooting guide for training issues
   - Performance benchmarks documented

6. **Integration with MCP validated**
   - Training examples can reference MCP memory operations
   - Context preservation patterns align with MCP policy system
   - Embedding compatibility validated (384-dim all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   - RAG integration pathway documented

#### Objective Components Addressed
This sprint delivers **Training System (Core)** success criteria:
- Dataset creation with instruction-input-output format
- QLoRA environment setup for M1 Max
- Context preservation pattern integration
- Custom knowledge embedding preparation
- Foundation for model training (Sprint 5+)

#### Dependencies
**Prerequisites:** Sprint 3 complete (MCP server operational)  
**Enables:** Sprint 5+ (actual model training, context preservation integration)

#### Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Medium-High  
**Mitigation:**
- **Hardware limitations:** Profile resource usage early, optimize batch size
- **Dataset quality:** Implement validation pipeline, iterate on examples
- **Framework complexity:** Start with simpler framework (MLX-LM), fallback to axolotl
- **Training time:** Estimate early with dry-run, adjust scope if needed
- **Context pattern design:** Review MCP patterns, align with preservation levels

### Sprint 3 (Complete)
- **Goal:** MCP Server Foundation
- **Status:** Complete (2025-10-03T05:00:00+02:00)
- **Achievements:** All 8 tasks complete, 6/6 exit criteria met, MCP server fully integrated

### Sprint 2 (Complete)
- **Goal:** OODATCAA Process Improvement
- **Status:** Complete (2025-10-05T04:21:47Z)
- **Achievements:** 7/7 exit criteria met, ~15,000 lines documentation
- **Outcome:** Background agents, log rotation, sprint management, agent documentation, process runbooks

### Sprint 1 (Deferred)
- **Goal:** MCP Server Foundation (original)
- **Status:** Deferred → became Sprint 3
- **Reason:** Sprint 2 prioritized OODATCAA infrastructure improvements first

**Next Steps:** Sprint Planner will update SPRINT_BACKLOG.md with refined work items and initialize SPRINT_QUEUE.json for Sprint 3 execution.
