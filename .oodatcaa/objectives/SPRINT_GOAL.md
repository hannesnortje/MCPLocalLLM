## Sprint 1: MCP Server Foundation

**Status:** `in_progress`  
**Started:** 2025-10-01  
**Timebox:** 7-10 working days  
**Objective Progress:** 0% → ~15% (Foundation milestone)

### Goal
Migrate and integrate the MCP server from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` to establish the core context preservation and memory management infrastructure.

### Exit Criteria
1. ✅ **MCP server successfully copied and adapted** from source repository
   - All essential files migrated without breaking OODATCAA system
   - File conflicts resolved (MCP files take precedence, preserve `.oodatcaa/`)
   - Package renamed from "mcp-memory-server" to "mcp-local-llm"

2. ✅ **Core MCP functionality operational**
   - Memory management system working (vector storage, retrieval)
   - Policy system intact (preservation levels, rule compliance)
   - Dependencies installed and compatible with this project

3. ✅ **Project structure integrated**
   - MCP server coexists with existing `src/mdnotes/` module
   - Python tooling passes: black, ruff, mypy (on new MCP code)
   - Basic smoke tests pass for MCP components

4. ✅ **Configuration updated**
   - `pyproject.toml` includes MCP dependencies
   - Docker/Qdrant configuration ready
   - Environment setup documented

5. ✅ **Initial documentation complete**
   - README updated with MCP integration overview
   - Setup instructions for MCP server
   - Architecture notes on how MCP enables training workflow

6. ✅ **Clean CI state**
   - All quality gates pass: black --check, ruff, mypy
   - Basic pytest suite runs successfully
   - No high-severity security issues (pip-audit)

### Objective Components Addressed
This sprint delivers **MCP Integration (Critical)** success criteria:
- ✅ Server Migration: Copy complete `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/` structure
- ✅ Clean and adapt for small coder training project
- ✅ Maintain core functionality: memory, vector search, policy system
- ✅ Update dependencies and configuration

### Dependencies
**Prerequisites:** None (first sprint)  
**Enables:** All future sprints depend on MCP infrastructure being operational

### Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- **File conflicts:** Preserve `.oodatcaa/` system files, prioritize MCP server files for conflicts
- **Dependency incompatibilities:** Test in isolated venv, use compatible versions
- **Breaking existing tooling:** Run full test suite before/after migration
- **Incomplete migration:** Create checklist of essential MCP components before copying
