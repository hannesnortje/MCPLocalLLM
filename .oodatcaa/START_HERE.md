# 🚀 START HERE - Complete OODATCAA Workflow

## ✅ System Reset Complete - Ready for Fresh Start!

All OODATCAA files have been reset to their initial state. The system is ready for autonomous development.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Launch the Negotiator (Status Checker)**

**PASTE THIS COMMAND in a NEW Cursor chat:**

```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/negotiator.md exactly.
CRITICAL: Follow the MANDATORY output format from @Cursor Rules.
Return only file diffs.
```

**Run as:** Once (not in background)

**Note:** Due to limitations with background agents, run the Negotiator **manually after each agent completes** to get the next action.

---

### **Step 2: Follow Negotiator Instructions**

The Negotiator will analyze the current state and give you **EXACT COMMANDS** like this:

```markdown
### 🎯 NEXT ACTION REQUIRED:

⚠️ **LAUNCH AGENT: Sprint Planner**

**EXACT COMMAND TO PASTE:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/sprint-planner.md exactly.
```

**Run as:** Once (not in background)
```

**Just copy and paste the command it gives you!**

---

### **Step 3: Complete the Workflow**

The typical flow will be:

1. **Negotiator** → Tells you to launch **Sprint Planner**
2. **Sprint Planner** → Creates Sprint 1, tells you to go back to Negotiator
3. **Negotiator** → Detects Sprint 1, tells you to launch **Planner**
4. **Planner** → Creates detailed plans, tells you to go back to Negotiator
5. **Negotiator** → Detects ready tasks, tells you to launch **Builder**
6. **Builder** → Implements code, tells you to go back to Negotiator
7. **Negotiator** → Detects completed work, tells you to launch **Tester**
8. ... and so on until Sprint 1 completes
9. **Negotiator** → Detects sprint complete, tells you to launch **Sprint Planner** for Sprint 2
10. Process repeats until project is complete!

## 🎯 Key Points

### ✅ **DO:**
- Always use the **EXACT COMMAND** provided by each agent
- Run Negotiator in **Background**
- Run all other agents **Once (not in background)**
- Follow the agent instructions at the **end of each response**

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't guess agent names (Sprint Planner ≠ Planner)
- Don't modify the commands
- Don't skip the Negotiator coordination
- Don't run multiple agents simultaneously

## 📊 Current Project State

- **Objective:** OBJ-2025-002 - MCPLocalLLM (Small Coder Model Training with MCP Integration)
- **Sprint:** None (awaiting Sprint Planner)
- **Tasks:** None (will be created by Sprint Planner)
- **Progress:** 0% (fresh start)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If Negotiator doesn't update:**
- Stop the background agent
- Start a NEW background Negotiator with the same command

**If confused about which agent to launch:**
- Check the last message from any agent - it will tell you what to do next
- The command will say the exact `.md` filename (e.g., `sprint-planner.md`)

---

## 🎯 Ready to Begin!

**Start by launching the Negotiator in background mode.**

The system will guide you through every step with exact, copy-paste commands. No guesswork needed!

**Good luck!** 🚀
