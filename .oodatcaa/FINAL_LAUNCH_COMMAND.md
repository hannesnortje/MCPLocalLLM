# 🎯 FINAL LAUNCH COMMAND - Use This!

## ✅ Everything is Clean and Ready

The OODATCAA system has been completely reset and configured with:
- ✅ Mandatory output format in `@Cursor Rules` (python.mdc)
- ✅ 1-minute Negotiator heartbeat
- ✅ Clean work files (no sprint, no tasks)
- ✅ Updated agent prompts with explicit format requirements

---

## 🚀 COPY-PASTE THIS EXACT COMMAND:

**Open a NEW Cursor chat and paste:**

```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/negotiator.md exactly.
CRITICAL: Follow the MANDATORY output format from @Cursor Rules.
Return only file diffs.
```

**Then click:** "Run in Background" ✨

---

## ✅ Expected Output Format:

The Negotiator MUST output this at the end:

```markdown
---

## 🎯 NEXT ACTION REQUIRED

**LAUNCH AGENT: Sprint Planner**

**COPY-PASTE THIS COMMAND:**
```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules. 
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/sprint-planner.md exactly.
```

**Run as:** Once (not in background)

**Why:** No sprint exists - need to create Sprint 1 from OBJECTIVE.md
**What it will do:** Analyze OBJECTIVE.md success criteria and create Sprint 1 with MCP migration tasks
```

---

## ❌ If You DON'T See This Format:

If the Negotiator doesn't provide the copy-paste code block, it means it's not following the rules. 

**Try this enhanced command:**

```
Load @Cursor Rules and @Project Rules.
IMPORTANT: Read the "CRITICAL: Agent Output Format (MANDATORY)" section in @Cursor Rules (python.mdc).
Run .oodatcaa/prompts/negotiator.md exactly.
Your response MUST end with the exact "🎯 NEXT ACTION REQUIRED" format showing a copy-paste code block for the next agent command.
DO NOT use the old format. Use the new mandatory format with the code block.
Return only file diffs.
```

---

## 📋 What the Format Must Include:

✅ **Section:** `## 🎯 NEXT ACTION REQUIRED`
✅ **Agent:** `**LAUNCH AGENT: <Name>**`
✅ **Code Block:** Exact command in ``` ``` code fence
✅ **Run As:** Clearly states Background or Once
✅ **Why:** Brief explanation
✅ **What:** Expected outcome

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Negotiator:

1. **Negotiator** tells you → Launch **Sprint Planner**
2. **Sprint Planner** tells you → Go back to **Negotiator** 
3. **Negotiator** detects sprint → Tells you → Launch **Planner**
4. **Planner** tells you → Go back to **Negotiator**
5. **Negotiator** detects ready tasks → Tells you → Launch **Builder**
6. And so on...

Each agent will give you the exact command to paste next!

---

## 🚀 Ready!

The system is configured, the format is enforced, everything is clean.

**Launch the Negotiator with the command above and the autonomous system will begin!**
