## Decision Rationale

### Primary Decision Factors

**1. M1 Max Optimization (Critical)**
MLX-LM is purpose-built for Apple Silicon with native Metal acceleration, providing significant performance advantages over PyTorch's MPS backend. This is our primary hardware constraint and MLX-LM is specifically designed for it.

**2. Memory Efficiency (High Priority)**
MLX-LM's unified memory architecture optimization aligns perfectly with our ‚â§16GB RAM target. Apple engineers tuned this specifically for M1/M2 memory characteristics, while PyTorch MPS is a generic port.

**3. Ease of Use (Medium Priority)**
Simple `pip install mlx-lm` with minimal dependencies reduces setup complexity and risk. Estimated 60-90 minutes vs 120-150 minutes for axolotl setup.

**4. QLoRA Support (High Priority)**
Both frameworks support QLoRA well, but MLX-LM has built-in quantization examples specifically for 7B models on M1 Max.

### Trade-offs Accepted

**What We Gain:**
- Native M1 Max performance optimization
- Superior memory efficiency (‚â§16GB target compliance)
- Simpler setup and maintenance
- Apple-backed framework with ongoing optimizations
- Better inference speed on M1 Max

**What We Lose:**
- Smaller community ecosystem (fewer examples than PyTorch)
- M1/M2 hardware lock-in (not portable to NVIDIA/AMD)
- Less battle-tested than PyTorch-based solutions
- Fewer pre-made configurations available

### Fallback Plan

If MLX-LM encounters compatibility issues during implementation:

**Quick Validation (30 minutes):**
- Test axolotl with same proof-of-concept setup
- Verify Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct compatibility
- Check memory usage with MPS backend

**Switch Decision (15 minutes):**
- Update plan documentation
- Document switch rationale
- Adjust timeline estimates

**Axolotl Implementation (90 minutes):**
- Follow Alternative 2 setup process
- Use MPS backend configuration
- Optimize for M1 Max memory constraints

**Total Fallback Cost:** ~135 minutes (still within Sprint 4 buffer)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **MLX-LM incompatible with Qwen2.5-Coder-7B** | Low | High | Test model loading early, fallback to axolotl |
| **Memory exceeds 16GB during training** | Medium | High | Profile memory early, reduce batch size if needed |
| **Model download fails (14GB size)** | Low | Medium | Document download process, use HuggingFace CLI |
| **Installation conflicts with MCP packages** | Medium | Medium | Use isolated venv, run pip check |
| **Inference too slow (>5 sec/token)** | Low | Low | Document limitation, proceed (not Sprint 4 goal) |

## Conclusion

**Apple MLX-LM** is the clear winner for our specific use case. Its native M1 Max optimization, superior memory efficiency, and built-in QLoRA support make it the optimal choice for fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct on M1 Max hardware.

The framework selection provides a solid foundation for Sprint 4's training system implementation, with axolotl as a proven fallback option if needed.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with MLX-LM installation and validation (Steps 2-5 of T001-B01).
