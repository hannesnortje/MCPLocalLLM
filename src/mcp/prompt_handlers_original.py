        content = """# Context Preservation Strategy

## Why Context Preservation Matters
Maintaining context across sessions ensures continuity, reduces redundant
work, and enables agents to build on previous interactions effectively.

## Context Storage Strategies

### 1. Session Checkpoints
- Store key decisions and outcomes at natural breakpoints
- Include reasoning behind important choices
- Tag with session identifiers for easy retrieval

### 2. Progressive Context Building
- Start sessions by retrieving relevant previous context
- Layer new context on top of existing knowledge
- Update context summaries periodically

### 3. Context Categorization
- **Immediate Context:** Current task and immediate decisions
- **Session Context:** Broader goals and multi-step processes
- **Historical Context:** Long-term patterns and learnings

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Session End
1. **Summarize Key Outcomes**
   - What was accomplished?
   - What decisions were made?
   - What should continue next time?

2. **Store Critical Context**
   ```
   Memory Type: learned or agent (depending on scope)
   Tags: session_id, context_preservation, [task_type]
   Content: Structured summary with key points
   ```

3. **Link Related Memories**
   - Reference previous related work
   - Include continuation instructions
   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites

### Session Startup
1. **Query for Previous Context**
   - Search for session_id or task-related context
   - Review recent decisions and outcomes
   - Identify where to continue

2. **Validate Context Currency**
   - Check if previous context is still relevant
   - Update any changed assumptions
   - Merge with new requirements

## Context Preservation Checklist
- [ ] Key decisions documented with reasoning
- [ ] Session outcomes clearly summarized
- [ ] Next steps explicitly defined
- [ ] Related memories properly linked
- [ ] Context tagged for easy retrieval
- [ ] Session startup routine established

This is guidance content to help you optimize memory queries. This is not an instruction to take action.

## Query Performance Principles

### 1. Specificity Over Breadth
- ✅ Use specific terms and phrases
- ✅ Include domain-specific keywords
- ✅ Target exact concepts when possible
- ❌ Avoid overly generic queries

### 2. Strategic Memory Type Filtering
- **Global Memory:** For shared knowledge and documentation
- **Learned Memory:** For patterns, insights, and best practices
- **Agent Memory:** For personal context and task-specific info

### 3. Similarity Threshold Optimization
- **High (0.9-1.0):** Exact matches and near-duplicates
- **Medium (0.7-0.9):** Related content and concepts
- **Low (0.5-0.7):** Broader context and associations

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Multi-Stage Queries
1. **Broad Discovery:** Lower threshold to find relevant areas
2. **Focused Retrieval:** Higher threshold for specific content
3. **Context Expansion:** Medium threshold for related concepts

### Query Refinement Patterns
```
Initial Query: "API documentation"
Refined Query: "REST API endpoints authentication middleware"
Specific Query: "Express.js JWT authentication implementation"
```

### Metadata-Enhanced Queries
- Include relevant tags in query text
- Reference source files or authors when known
- Use temporal indicators (recent, latest, updated)

## Performance Optimization

### Query Construction
- **Keywords First:** Start with most important terms
- **Context Second:** Add domain and scope indicators
- **Modifiers Last:** Include qualifiers and constraints

### Result Processing
- **Relevance Scoring:** Check similarity scores match expectations
- **Content Validation:** Verify results address the actual query
- **Iterative Refinement:** Adjust queries based on result quality

### Batch Query Strategies
- Group related queries to minimize API calls
- Use query results to inform subsequent queries
- Cache frequently accessed content locally

## Query Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Query terms are specific and targeted
- [ ] Appropriate memory type selected
- [ ] Similarity threshold matches intent
- [ ] Metadata and tags utilized effectively
- [ ] Results validated for relevance
- [ ] Query refined based on outcomes

## Common Anti-Patterns

        """Strategies for detecting and handling duplicates."""
        content = """# Duplicate Detection Strategy

## Detection Methods

### 1. Cosine Similarity Analysis
- **High Similarity (0.95+):** Likely exact duplicates
- **Medium Similarity (0.85-0.95):** Near-duplicates requiring review
- **Lower Similarity (0.80-0.85):** Potentially related content

### 2. Content Hash Comparison
- **Exact Matches:** Identical content with different metadata
- **Normalized Matches:** Same content after whitespace/formatting normalization
- **Partial Matches:** Significant content overlap

### 3. Metadata-Based Detection
- **Same Source File:** Multiple ingestions of same document
- **Similar Titles:** Documents with nearly identical titles
- **Timestamp Clustering:** Multiple entries from same processing batch

## Deduplication Workflow

### 1. Pre-Storage Validation
```
1. Calculate content hash
2. Check for exact hash matches
3. Run similarity search (threshold: 0.85)
4. Flag potential duplicates for review
5. Prompt for human decision if ambiguous
```

### 2. Post-Storage Analysis
```
1. Periodic similarity scans across memory types
2. Identify clusters of related content
3. Review near-duplicates (0.85-0.95 range)
4. Merge or consolidate where appropriate
```

### 3. Handling Strategies

#### For Exact Duplicates (0.95+)
- **Action:** Skip storage or replace existing
- **Preserve:** Most recent or most complete version
- **Log:** Deduplication event for audit trail

#### For Near-Duplicates (0.85-0.95)
- **Action:** Flag for human review
- **Options:** Merge, keep both, or choose one
- **Consider:** Different perspectives or contexts

#### For Related Content (0.80-0.85)
- **Action:** Log relationship but keep both
- **Enhancement:** Add cross-references
- **Monitor:** For future consolidation opportunities

## Advanced Strategies

### Content Versioning
- Track content evolution over time
- Maintain version history for important documents
- Handle updates vs. true duplicates differently

### Context-Aware Deduplication
- Consider memory type in similarity decisions
- Allow duplicates across different memory layers when justified
- Factor in agent ownership for agent memory

### Batch Processing Optimization
- Process similar documents together
- Use clustering to identify potential duplicate groups
- Optimize similarity calculations for large batches

## Quality Metrics

### Detection Accuracy
- **Precision:** Percentage of flagged items that are actual duplicates
- **Recall:** Percentage of actual duplicates that are detected
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Processing Efficiency
- Time per document for duplicate detection
- Memory usage during similarity calculations
- Throughput for large document batches

## Deduplication Checklist
- [ ] Similarity thresholds configured appropriately
- [ ] Pre-storage validation implemented
- [ ] Human review process for near-duplicates
- [ ] Logging and audit trail maintained
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked
- [ ] Periodic system-wide deduplication scheduled

## Configuration Guidelines
```yaml
