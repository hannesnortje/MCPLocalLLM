# Principles

This document defines the core principles that govern all MCP Memory Server operations and agent behavior.

## Core Values

### Data Integrity
- [P-001] All data stored in the memory system must maintain integrity and accuracy throughout its lifecycle
- [P-002] Memory operations must be atomic and consistent to prevent data corruption
- [P-003] Vector embeddings must accurately represent the semantic meaning of stored content

### Agent Responsibility
- [P-004] Each agent must be uniquely identifiable and accountable for its memory operations
- [P-005] Agents must respect memory layer boundaries and access permissions
- [P-006] Agent actions that affect shared memory must be logged for transparency

### System Reliability
- [P-007] The memory system must gracefully handle failures and provide error recovery
- [P-008] Performance degradation must be detected and reported through health monitoring
- [P-009] System resources must be used efficiently to ensure scalability

### Privacy and Security
- [P-010] Agent-specific memory must remain isolated from other agents unless explicitly shared
- [P-011] Sensitive information must be handled according to data protection requirements
- [P-012] Access to memory collections must be authenticated and authorized

### Semantic Consistency
- [P-013] Memory content must be semantically meaningful and searchable
- [P-014] Duplicate content detection must maintain high accuracy while allowing legitimate variations
- [P-015] Content optimization must preserve original meaning while improving searchability
