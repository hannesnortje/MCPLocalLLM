## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Sprint 1: MCP Server Foundation

##### [W001] - 2025-10-02 - MCP Source Structure Analysis
- **Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive analysis of MCP server source structure from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
- **7 Analysis Artifacts Created** (2,690+ lines total):
  - `mcp_structure_inventory.md` - Complete MCP source tree (23 directories, 161 files)
  - `essential_components.md` - 67 essential files identified with rationale
  - `conflict_resolution.md` - 11 conflicts resolved (8 files + 3 directories)
  - `dependencies.md` - 12 dependencies documented (10 prod + 2 dev)
  - `pyproject_toml_updates.md` - Detailed merge strategy for dependencies
  - `migration_checklist.md` - 24-step migration execution plan
  - `W001_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary with recommendations

**Key Findings:**
- Essential MCP components: 67 files (core server, memory, handlers, tools, policy)
- Exclusions: 40+ files (UI components, PySide6, websockets, examples)
- File conflicts: 8 root files, 3 directory conflicts - all resolved
- Dependencies: No conflicts with existing project dependencies
- Risk level: LOW
- Migration readiness: HIGH

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ All CI gates pass (black, ruff, mypy, pytest)
- ✅ 100% test coverage maintained
- ✅ All 10 acceptance criteria met

**Branch:** `feat/W001-step-01-analyze-source`  
**Tag:** `W001-complete`  
**Commits:** 9 commits (3 implementation, 3 planning, 2 build, 1 refactor)  
**Next:** W002 - Execute MCP Server Migration

##### [W002] - 2025-10-02 - MCP Server Migration
- **Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated 61 MCP server files from `/media/hannesn/storage/Code/MCP/`
- **Files Migrated:**
  - 31 Python files in `src/mcp/` (handlers, memory, prompts, tools)
  - 4 policy governance documents in `policy/`
  - 12 documentation files in `docs/mcp/`
  - 3 utility scripts in `scripts/` (deploy.sh, maintenance.sh, setup-dev.sh)
  - Infrastructure: docker-compose.yml, launcher.py, memory_server.py, .env.example, config.example.yaml
  - Configuration: .gitignore merged with MCP-specific entries

**Migration Achievement:**
- **Total files:** 61 files successfully copied
- **Code formatted:** All files formatted with black (line-length=100)
- **UI excluded:** No PySide6, websockets, or UI components (as planned)
- **Protection verified:** .oodatcaa/ and src/mdnotes/ completely preserved
- **No regressions:** All existing tests pass (2/2 smoke tests)

**Directory Structure:**
- `src/mcp/` - Core MCP server with 4 subdirectories (handlers, memory, prompts, tools)
- `policy/` - 4 markdown governance files
- `docs/mcp/` - Complete MCP documentation
- `scripts/` - Deployment and maintenance utilities
- Root: Server entry points and infrastructure files

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ black --check: All code formatted correctly
- ⚠️ ruff: Expected linting errors (to be fixed in W004)
- ✅ pytest: All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- ✅ python -m build: Package builds successfully with MCP modules
- ✅ All 10 acceptance criteria met

**Protection Checks (All PASS):**
- ✅ Zero modifications to `.oodatcaa/` system files
- ✅ Zero modifications to `src/mdnotes/` module
- ✅ No Python syntax errors in migrated code
- ✅ File count within expected range (61 vs 60-70 expected)

**Known Issues (Expected, To Be Resolved):**
- Import sorting and type annotations (W004 will address)
- Missing MCP dependencies (W003 will install)
- Type errors due to missing dependencies (W003 will resolve)

**Branch:** `feat/W002-step-01-copy-mcp-core`  
**Tag:** `W002-complete`  
**Commits:** 10 commits (1 implementation, 1 refactor, 5 planning, 3 build)  
**Next:** W003 - Integrate MCP Dependencies
